    <h2>Below, you'll find some example tidbits of the "stories" that my fine-tuned GPT-2 model has produced. Apparently, it is very interested in sparkling wine and occasionally very dramatic. No, I do not know what a "workahogurt" is.</h2>
    <h2>"The rival ghosts were silent as they stared at each other. Even at this late hour in the match, the sharp contrast between the two phantoms told those phantoms that there was no room for any two of us in the room. As the appearance of the rival ghosts told them that there was no space between them and the light, and that the light in the room was on an object of no real discernment, they were more than willing to overlook it. They looked at, too, into the wall. As soon as the door was opened they saw something, but they could not see in, and were not able to solve the mystery. They spoke to each other, to no avail. They talked in whispers, and in any number of ways which partly explained their actions, but also proved to be uncalled for and unable to solve."</h2>
    <h2>"I'm sure the next person to see me will feel the same love I feel for you. The little dog was still so tired from his breakfast that he had to be carried away by the appearance of several feet of water that seemed to relieve him of all ordinary exertions. The journey home was now over, and I felt sure that my servant was returning with two bottles of bitter wine and a jug of sparkling water. He had brought with him several curious bottles of wine--the standing-room-only bottles--that had been lost under the deluge two weeks ago in the torrent of molasses that had dumped them. The first specimen I saw of the kind produced in Germany was a bottle of sparkling wine (that has not been mentioned in this connection anguishing from the bottles), a bottle of silver, and a glass of fine sparkling wine. As the feeling for the valuable wine returned I felt a change in my companion's attitude; his eagerness was much illumined by the unaccountable sweetness the water in the bottles. Even then it was surprising to see such a beautiful animal among the spoils of valor among people of exceptional learning and talent."</h2>
    <h2>"And I am sure that no words are wanting from me when, in the near future, I shall have to die alone in my home, as a ghostly phantom waves at my memory. I know you will find my name in the annals of copy and notes, but I feel sure you will not find me alive. So, whatever your opinion of me, read, and weep with me, till the end. I am Captain Watson."</h2>
    <h2>"From the very first moment, when she was comfortably asleep, that the terror of the previous night suddenly manifested itself in a sort of 'sting' (malignant heritable form); and this terror was intensified by the fact that, being thus 'stressed,' she seemed to become more aware of and more eager to fight the demons within. Indeed, her restless eyes, focused more on the work than on the work itself, which was so unfair to the poor little woman! Still, it was not at all easy to get the 'ghost' to fight off the absence of the 'workahogurt.'"</h2>
