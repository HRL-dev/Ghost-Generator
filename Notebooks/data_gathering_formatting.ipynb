       "What is the fascination we feel for the mystery of the ghost story?\n",
       "\n",
       "Is it of the same nature as the fascination which we feel for the\n",
       "mystery of the detective story?\n",
       "\n",
       "Of the latter fascination, the late Paul Armstrong used to say that it\n",
       "was because we are all as full of crime as Sing Sing--only we don't\n",
       "dare.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus, may I ask, are we not fascinated by the ghost story because, no\n",
       "matter what may be the scientific or skeptical bent of our minds, in our\n",
       "inmost souls, secretly perhaps, we are as full of superstition as an\n",
       "obeah man--only we don't let it loose?\n",
       "\n",
       "Who shall say that he is able to fling off lightly the inheritance of\n",
       "countless ages of superstition? Is there not a streak of superstition in\n",
       "us all? We laugh at the voodoo worshiper--then create our own hoodooes,\n",
       "our pet obsessions.\n",
       "\n",
       "It has been said that man is incurably religious, that if all religions\n",
       "were blotted out, man would create a new religion.\n",
       "\n",
       "Man is incurably fascinated by the mysterious. If all the ghost stories\n",
       "of the ages were blotted out, man would invent new ones.\n",
       "\n",
       "For, do we not all stand in awe of that which we cannot explain, of that\n",
       "which, if it be not in our own experience, is certainly recorded in the\n",
       "experience of others, of that of which we know and can know nothing?\n",
       "\n",
       "Skeptical though one may be of the occult, he must needs be interested\n",
       "in things that others believe to be objective--that certainly are\n",
       "subjectively very real to them.\n",
       "\n",
       "The ghost story is not born of science, nor even of super-science,\n",
       "whatever that may be. It is not of science at all. It is of another\n",
       "sphere, despite all that the psychic researchers have tried to\n",
       "demonstrate.\n",
       "\n",
       "There are in life two sorts of people who, for want of a better\n",
       "classification, I may call the psychic and the non-psychic. If I ask the\n",
       "psychic to close his eyes and I say to him, \"Horse,\" he immediately\n",
       "visualizes a horse. The other, non-psychic, does not. I rather incline\n",
       "to believe that it is the former class who see ghosts, or rather some of\n",
       "them. The latter do not--though they share interest in them.\n",
       "\n",
       "The artists are of the visualizing class and, in our more modern times,\n",
       "it is the psychic who think in motion pictures, or at least in a\n",
       "succession of still pictures.\n",
       "\n",
       "However we explain the ghostly and supernatural, whether we give it\n",
       "objective or merely subjective reality, neither explanation prevents the\n",
       "non-psychic from being intensely interested in the visions of the\n",
       "psychic.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus I am convinced that if we were all quite honest with ourselves,\n",
       "whether we believe in or do not believe in ghosts, at least we are all\n",
       "deeply interested in them. There is in this interest something that\n",
       "makes all the world akin.\n",
       "\n",
       "Who does not feel a suppressed start at the creaking of furniture in the\n",
       "dark of night? Who has not felt a shiver of goose flesh, controlled only\n",
       "by an effort of will? Who, in the dark, has not had the feeling of some\n",
       "_thing_ behind him--and, in spite of his conscious reasoning, turned to\n",
       "look?\n",
       "\n",
       "If there be any who has not, it may be that to him ghost stories have no\n",
       "fascination. Let him at least, however, be honest.\n",
       "\n",
       "To every human being mystery appeals, be it that of the crime cases on\n",
       "which a large part of yellow journalism is founded, or be it in the\n",
       "cases of Dupin, of Le Coq, of Sherlock Holmes, of Arsene Lupin, of Craig\n",
       "Kennedy, or a host of others of our fiction mystery characters. The\n",
       "appeal is in the mystery.\n",
       "\n",
       "The detective's case is solved at the end, however. But even at the end\n",
       "of a ghost story, the underlying mystery remains. In the ghost story, we\n",
       "have the very quintessence of mystery.\n",
       "\n",
       "Authors, publishers, editors, dramatists, writers of motion pictures\n",
       "tell us that never before has there been such an intense and wide\n",
       "interest in mystery stories as there is to-day. That in itself explains\n",
       "the interest in the super-mystery story of the ghost and ghostly doings.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another element of mystery lies in such stories. Deeper and further\n",
       "back, is the supreme mystery of life--after death--what?\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Impossible,\" scorns the non-psychic as he listens to some ghost story.\n",
       "\n",
       "To which, doggedly replies the mind of the opposite type, \"Not so.\n",
       "I believe _because_ it is impossible.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The uncanny, the unhealthy--as in the master of such writing,\n",
       "Poe--fascinates. Whether we will or no, the imp of the perverse lures us\n",
       "on.\n",
       "\n",
       "That is why we read with enthralled interest these excursions into the\n",
       "eerie unknown, perhaps reading on till the mystic hour of midnight\n",
       "increases the creepy pleasure.\n",
       "\n",
       "One might write a volume of analysis and appreciation of this aptly\n",
       "balanced anthology of ghost stories assembled here after years of\n",
       "reading and study by Mr. J.L. French.\n",
       "\n",
       "Foremost among the impressions that a casual reader will derive is the\n",
       "interesting fact, just as in detective mystery stories, so in ghost\n",
       "stories, styles change. Each age, each period has the ghost story\n",
       "peculiar to itself. To-day, there is a new style of ghost story\n",
       "gradually evolving.\n",
       "\n",
       "Once stories were of fairies, fays, trolls, the \"little people,\" of\n",
       "poltergiest and loup garou. Through various ages we have progressed to\n",
       "the ghost story of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries until to-day,\n",
       "in the twentieth, we are seeing a modern style, which the new science is\n",
       "modifying materially.\n",
       "\n",
       "High among the stories in this volume, one must recognize the masterful\n",
       "art of Algernon Blackwood's \"The Woman's Ghost Story.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I was interested in psychic things,\" says the woman as she starts to\n",
       "tell her story simply, with a sweep toward the climax that has the ring\n",
       "of the truth of fiction. Here perhaps we have the modern style of ghost\n",
       "story at its best.\n",
       "\n",
       "Times change as well as styles. \"The Man Who Went Too Far\" is of intense\n",
       "interest as an attempt to bring into our own times an interpretation of\n",
       "the symbolism underlying Greek mythology, applied to England of some\n",
       "years ago.\n",
       "\n",
       "To see Pan meant death. Hence in this story there is a philosophy of\n",
       "Pan-theism--no \"me,\" no \"you,\" no \"it.\" It is a mystical story, with a\n",
       "storm scene in which is painted a picture that reminds one strongly of\n",
       "\"The Fall of the House of Ushur,\"--with the frankly added words, \"On him\n",
       "were marks of hoofs of a monstrous goat that had leaped on\n",
       "him,\"--uncompromising mysticism.\n",
       "\n",
       "Happy is the Kipling selection, \"The Phantom 'Rickshaw,\" if only for\n",
       "that obiter dictum of ghost-presence as Kipling explains about the rift\n",
       "in the brain: \"--and a little bit of the Dark World came through and\n",
       "pressed him to death!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Then there are the racial styles in ghost stories. The volume takes us\n",
       "from the \"Banshees and Other Death Warnings\" of Ireland to a strange\n",
       "example of Jewish mysticism in \"The Silent Woman.\" Mr. French has been\n",
       "very wide in his choice, giving us these as well as many examples from\n",
       "the literature of England and France. Finally, he has compiled from the\n",
       "newspapers, as typically American, many ghost stories of New York and\n",
       "other parts of the country.\n",
       "\n",
       "Strange that one should find humor in a subject so weird. Yet we find\n",
       "it. Take, for instance, De Foe's old narrative, \"The Apparition of Mrs.\n",
       "Veal.\" It is a hoax, nothing more. Of our own times is Ellis Parker\n",
       "Butler's \"Dey Ain't No Ghosts,\" showing an example of the modern Negro's\n",
       "racial heritage.\n",
       "\n",
       "In our literature and on the stage, the very idea of a Darky and a\n",
       "graveyard is mirth-provoking. Mr. Butler extracts some pithy philosophy\n",
       "from his Darky boy: \"I ain't skeered ob ghosts whut am, c'ase dey ain't\n",
       "no ghosts, but I jes' feel kinder oneasy 'bout de ghosts whut ain't!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Humor is succeeded by pathos. In \"The Interval\" we find a sympathetic\n",
       "twist to the ghost story--an actual desire to meet the dead.\n",
       "\n",
       "It is not, however, to be compared for interest to the story of sheer\n",
       "terror, as in Bulwer-Lytton's \"The Haunted and the Haunters,\" with the\n",
       "flight of the servant in terror, the cowering of the dog against the\n",
       "wall, the death of the dog, its neck actually broken by the terror, and\n",
       "all that go to make an experience in a haunted house what it should be.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus, at last, we come to two of the stories that attempt to give a\n",
       "scientific explanation, another phase of the modern style of ghost\n",
       "story.\n",
       "\n",
       "One of these, perhaps hardly modern as far as mere years are concerned,\n",
       "is this same story of Bulwer, \"The Haunted and the Haunters.\" Besides\n",
       "being a rattling good old-fashioned tale of horror, it attempts a\n",
       "new-fashioned scientific explanation. It is enough to read and re-read\n",
       "it.\n",
       "\n",
       "It is, however, the lamented Ambrose Bierce who has gone furthest in the\n",
       "science and the philosophy of the matter, and in a very short story,\n",
       "too, splendidly titled \"The Damned Thing.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "          \"Incredible!\" exclaims the coroner at the inquest.\n",
       "\n",
       "          \"That is nothing to you, sir,\" replies the\n",
       "          newspaper man who relates the experience, and in\n",
       "          these words expresses the true feeling about\n",
       "          ghostly fiction, \"that is nothing to you, if I\n",
       "          also swear that it is true!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But furthest of all in his scientific explanation--not scientifically\n",
       "explaining away, but in explaining the way--goes Bierce as he outlines a\n",
       "theory. From the diary of the murdered man he picks out the following\n",
       "which we may treasure as a gem:\n",
       "\n",
       "          \"I am not mad. There are colors that we cannot\n",

       "          such a color!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This fascination of the ghost story--have I made it clear?\n",
       "\n",
       "As I write, nearing midnight, the bookcase behind me cracks. I start and\n",
       "turn. Nothing. There is a creak of a board in the hallway.\n",
       "\n",
       "I know it is the cool night wind--the uneven contraction of materials\n",

       "A RELATION OF THE APPARITION OF MRS. VEAL\n",
       "\n",
       "This thing is so rare in all its circumstances, and on so good\n",
       "authority, that my reading and conversation has not given me anything\n",
       "like it: it is fit to gratify the most ingenious and serious inquirer.\n",
       "Mrs. Bargrave is the person to whom Mrs. Veal appeared after her death;\n",
       "she is my intimate friend, and I can avouch for her reputation, for\n",
       "these last fifteen or sixteen years, on my own knowledge; and I can\n",
       "confirm the good character she had from her youth, to the time of my\n",
       "acquaintance. Though, since this relation, she is calumniated by some\n",
       "people, that are friends to the brother of this Mrs. Veal, who appeared;\n",
       "who think the relation of this appearance to be a reflection, and\n",
       "endeavor what they can to blast Mrs. Bargrave's reputation, and to laugh\n",
       "the story out of countenance. But by the circumstances thereof, and the\n",
       "cheerful disposition of Mrs. Bargrave, notwithstanding the ill-usage of\n",
       "a very wicked husband, there is not yet the least sign of dejection in\n",
       "her face; nor did I ever hear her let fall a desponding or murmuring\n",
       "expression; nay, not when actually under her husband's barbarity; which\n",
       "I have been witness to, and several other persons of undoubted\n",
       "reputation.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now you must know, Mrs. Veal was a maiden gentlewoman of about thirty\n",
       "years of age, and for some years last past had been troubled with fits;\n",
       "which were perceived coming on her, by her going off from her discourse\n",
       "very abruptly to some impertinence. She was maintained by an only\n",
       "brother, and kept his house in Dover. She was a very pious woman, and\n",
       "her brother a very sober man to all appearance; but now he does all he\n",
       "can to null or quash the story. Mrs. Veal was intimately acquainted with\n",
       "Mrs. Bargrave from her childhood. Mrs. Veal's circumstances were then\n",
       "mean; her father did not take care of his children as he ought, so that\n",
       "they were exposed to hardships; and Mrs. Bargrave, in those days, had as\n",
       "unkind a father, though she wanted neither for food nor clothing, whilst\n",
       "Mrs. Veal wanted for both; insomuch that she would often say, Mrs.\n",
       "Bargrave, you are not only the best, but the only friend I have in the\n",
       "world, and no circumstances of life shall ever dissolve my friendship.\n",
       "They would often condole each other's adverse fortunes, and read\n",
       "together Drelincourt upon Death, and other good books; and so, like two\n",
       "Christian friends, they comforted each other under their sorrow.\n",
       "\n",
       "Some time after, Mr. Veal's friends got him a place in the custom-house\n",
       "at Dover, which occasioned Mrs. Veal, by little and little, to fall off\n",
       "from her intimacy with Mrs. Bargrave, though there was never any such\n",
       "thing as a quarrel; but an indifferency came on by degrees, till at last\n",
       "Mrs. Bargrave had not seen her in two years and a half; though above a\n",
       "twelvemonth of the time Mrs. Bargrave hath been absent from Dover, and\n",
       "this last half year has been in Canterbury about two months of the time,\n",
       "dwelling in a house of her own.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this house, on the 8th of September, 1705, she was sitting alone in\n",
       "the forenoon, thinking over her unfortunate life, and arguing herself\n",
       "into a due resignation to providence, though her condition seemed hard.\n",
       "And, said she, I have been provided for hitherto, and doubt not but I\n",
       "shall be still; and am well satisfied that my afflictions shall end when\n",
       "it is most fit for me: and then took up her sewing-work, which she had\n",
       "no sooner done, but she hears a knocking at the door. She went to see\n",
       "who was there, and this proved to be Mrs. Veal, her old friend, who was\n",
       "in a riding-habit. At that moment of time the clock struck twelve at\n",
       "noon.\n",
       "\n",
       "Madam, says Mrs. Bargrave, I am surprised to see you, you have been so\n",
       "long a stranger; but told her, she was glad to see her, and offered to\n",
       "salute her; which Mrs. Veal complied with, till their lips almost\n",
       "touched; and then Mrs. Veal drew her hand across her own eyes, and said,\n",
       "I am not very well; and so waived it. She told Mrs. Bargrave, she was\n",
       "going a journey, and had a great mind to see her first. But, says Mrs.\n",
       "Bargrave, how came you to take a journey alone? I am amazed at it,\n",
       "because I know you have a fond brother. Oh! says Mrs. Veal, I gave my\n",
       "brother the slip, and came away because I had so great a desire to see\n",
       "you before I took my journey. So Mrs. Bargrave went in with her, into\n",
       "another room within the first, and Mrs. Veal sat her down in an\n",
       "elbow-chair, in which Mrs. Bargrave was sitting when she heard Mrs. Veal\n",
       "knock. Then says Mrs. Veal, My dear friend, I am come to renew our old\n",
       "friendship again, and beg your pardon for my breach of it; and if you\n",
       "can forgive me, you are the best of women. O, says Mrs. Bargrave, do not\n",
       "mention such a thing; I have not had an uneasy thought about it; I can\n",
       "easily forgive it. What did you think of me? said Mrs. Veal. Says Mrs.\n",
       "Bargrave, I thought you were like the rest of the world, and that\n",
       "prosperity had made you forget yourself and me. Then Mrs. Veal reminded\n",
       "Mrs. Bargrave of the many friendly offices she did her in former days,\n",
       "and much of the conversation they had with each other in the times of\n",
       "their adversity; what books they read, and what comfort, in particular,\n",
       "they received from Drelincourt's Book of Death, which was the best, she\n",
       "said, on that subject ever written. She also mentioned Dr. Sherlock, the\n",
       "two Dutch books which were translated, written upon death, and several\n",
       "others. But Drelincourt, she said, had the clearest notions of death,\n",
       "and of the future state, of any who had handled that subject. Then she\n",
       "asked Mrs. Bargrave, whether she had Drelincourt. She said, Yes. Says\n",
       "Mrs. Veal, Fetch it. And so Mrs. Bargrave goes up stairs and brings it\n",
       "down. Says Mrs. Veal, Dear Mrs. Bargrave, if the eyes of our faith were\n",
       "as open as the eyes of our body, we should see numbers of angels about\n",
       "us for our guard. The notions we have of heaven now, are nothing like\n",
       "what it is, as Drelincourt says; therefore be comforted under your\n",
       "afflictions, and believe that the Almighty has a particular regard to\n",
       "you; and that your afflictions are marks of God's favor; and when they\n",
       "have done the business they are sent for, they shall be removed from\n",
       "you. And believe me, my dear friend, believe what I say to you, one\n",
       "minute of future happiness will infinitely reward you for all your\n",
       "sufferings. For, I can never believe (and claps her hand upon her knee\n",
       "with great earnestness, which indeed ran through most of her discourse),\n",
       "that ever God will suffer you to spend all your days in this afflicted\n",
       "state; but be assured, that your afflictions shall leave you, or you\n",
       "them, in a short time. She spake in that pathetical and heavenly\n",
       "manner, that Mrs. Bargrave wept several times, she was so deeply\n",
       "affected with it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Mrs. Veal mentioned Dr. Kenrick's Ascetick, at the end of which he\n",
       "gives an account of the lives of the primitive Christians. Their pattern\n",
       "she recommended to our imitation, and said, their conversation was not\n",
       "like this of our age: For now, says she, there is nothing but frothy,\n",
       "vain discourse, which is far different from theirs. Theirs was to\n",
       "edification, and to build one another up in faith; so that they were not\n",
       "as we are, nor are we as they were: but, says she, we ought to do as\n",
       "they did. There was an hearty friendship among them; but where is it now\n",
       "to be found? Says Mrs. Bargrave, It is hard indeed to find a true friend\n",
       "in these days. Says Mrs. Veal, Mr. Norris has a fine copy of verses,\n",
       "called Friendship in Perfection, which I wonderfully admire. Have you\n",
       "seen the book? says Mrs. Veal. No, says Mrs. Bargrave, but I have the\n",
       "verses of my own writing out. Have you? says Mrs. Veal, then fetch them.\n",
       "Which she did from above stairs, and offered them to Mrs. Veal to read,\n",
       "who refused, and waived the thing, saying, holding down her head would\n",
       "make it ache; and then desired Mrs. Bargrave to read them to her, which\n",
       "she did. As they were admiring friendship, Mrs. Veal said, Dear Mrs.\n",
       "Bargrave, I shall love you for ever. In these verses there is twice used\n",
       "the word Elysian. Ah! says Mrs. Veal, these poets have such names for\n",
       "heaven. She would often draw her hands across her own eyes, and say,\n",
       "Mrs. Bargrave, do not you think I am mightily impaired by my fits? No,\n",
       "says Mrs. Bargrave, I think you look as well as ever I knew you. After\n",
       "all this discourse, which the apparition put in much finer words than\n",
       "Mrs. Bargrave said she could pretend to, and as much more than she can\n",
       "remember, (for it cannot be thought, that an hour and three quarters'\n",
       "conversation could all be retained, though the main of it she thinks she\n",
       "does,) she said to Mrs. Bargrave, she would have her write a letter to\n",
       "her brother, and tell him, she would have him give rings to such and\n",
       "such; and that there was a purse of gold in her cabinet, and that she\n",
       "would have two broad pieces given to her cousin Watson.\n",
       "\n",
       "Talking at this rate, Mrs. Bargrave thought that a fit was coming upon\n",
       "her, and so placed herself in a chair just before her knees, to keep her\n",
       "from falling to the ground, if her fits should occasion it: for the\n",
       "elbow-chair, she thought, would keep her from falling on either side.\n",
       "And to divert Mrs. Veal, as she thought, took hold of her gown-sleeve\n",
       "several times, and commended it. Mrs. Veal told her, it was a scowered\n",
       "silk, and newly made up. But for all this, Mrs. Veal persisted in her\n",
       "request, and told Mrs. Bargrave, she must not deny her: and she would\n",
       "have her tell her brother all their conversation, when she had\n",
       "opportunity. Dear Mrs. Veal, says Mrs. Bargrave, this seems so\n",
       "impertinent, that I cannot tell how to comply with it; and what a\n",
       "mortifying story will our conversation be to a young gentleman? Why,\n",
       "says Mrs. Bargrave, it is much better, methinks, to do it yourself. No,\n",
       "says Mrs. Veal, though it seems impertinent to you now, you will see\n",
       "more reason for it hereafter. Mrs. Bargrave then, to satisfy her\n",
       "importunity, was going to fetch a pen and ink; but Mrs. Veal said, Let\n",
       "it alone now, but do it when I am gone; but you must be sure to do it:\n",
       "which was one of the last things she enjoined her at parting; and so she\n",
       "promised her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Mrs. Veal asked for Mrs. Bargrave's daughter; she said, she was not\n",
       "at home: But if you have a mind to see her, says Mrs. Bargrave, I'll\n",
       "send for her. Do, says Mrs. Veal. On which she left her, and went to a\n",
       "neighbor's to seek for her; and by the time Mrs. Bargrave was returning,\n",
       "Mrs. Veal was got without the door in the street, in the face of the\n",
       "beast-market, on a Saturday, which is market-day, and stood ready to\n",
       "part, as soon as Mrs. Bargrave came to her. She asked her, why she was\n",
       "in such haste. She said she must be going, though perhaps she might not\n",
       "go her journey till Monday; and told Mrs. Bargrave, she hoped she should\n",
       "see her again at her cousin Watson's, before she went whither she was\n",
       "going. Then she said, she would take her leave of her, and walked from\n",
       "Mrs. Bargrave in her view, till a turning interrupted the sight of her,\n",
       "which was three quarters after one in the afternoon.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Veal died the 7th of September, at twelve o'clock at noon of her\n",
       "fits, and had not above four hours' senses before her death, in which\n",
       "time she received the sacrament. The next day after Mrs. Veal's\n",
       "appearing, being Sunday, Mrs. Bargrave was mightily indisposed with a\n",
       "cold, and a sore throat, that she could not go out that day; but on\n",
       "Monday morning she sent a person to Captain Watson's, to know if Mrs.\n",
       "Veal was there. They wondered at Mrs. Bargrave's inquiry; and sent her\n",
       "word, that she was not there, nor was expected. At this answer Mrs.\n",
       "Bargrave told the maid she had certainly mistook the name, or made some\n",
       "blunder. And though she was ill, she put on her hood, and went herself\n",
       "to Captain Watson's though she knew none of the family, to see if Mrs.\n",
       "Veal was there or not. They said, they wondered at her asking, for that\n",
       "she had not been in town; they were sure, if she had, she would have\n",
       "been there. Says Mrs. Bargrave, I am sure she was with me on Saturday\n",
       "almost two hours. They said, it was impossible; for they must have seen\n",
       "her if she had. In comes Captain Watson, while they were in dispute, and\n",
       "said, that Mrs. Veal was certainly dead, and her escutcheons were\n",
       "making. This strangely surprised Mrs. Bargrave, when she sent to the\n",
       "person immediately who had the care of them, and found it true. Then she\n",
       "related the whole story to Captain Watson's family, and what gown she\n",
       "had on, and how striped; and that Mrs. Veal told her, it was scowered.\n",
       "Then Mrs. Watson cried out, You have seen her indeed, for none knew, but\n",
       "Mrs. Veal and myself, that the gown was scowered. And Mrs. Watson owned,\n",
       "that she described the gown exactly: For, said she, I helped her to make\n",
       "it up. This Mrs. Watson blazed all about the town, and avouched the\n",
       "demonstration of the truth of Mrs. Bargrave's seeing Mrs. Veal's\n",
       "apparition. And Captain Watson carried two gentlemen immediately to Mrs.\n",
       "Bargrave's house, to hear the relation of her own mouth. And when it\n",
       "spread so fast, that gentlemen and persons of quality, the judicious and\n",
       "skeptical part of the world, flocked in upon her, it at last became such\n",
       "a task, that she was forced to go out of the way. For they were, in\n",
       "general, extremely satisfied of the truth of the thing, and plainly saw\n",
       "that Mrs. Bargrave was no hypochondraic; for she always appears with\n",
       "such a cheerful air, and pleasing mien, that she has gained the favor\n",
       "and esteem of all the gentry; and it is thought a great favor, if they\n",
       "can but get the relation from her own mouth. I should have told you\n",
       "before, that Mrs. Veal told Mrs. Bargrave, that her sister and\n",
       "brother-in-law were just come down from London to see her. Says Mrs.\n",
       "Bargrave, How came you to order matters so strangely? It could not be\n",
       "helped, says Mrs. Veal. And her brother and sister did come to see her,\n",
       "and entered the town of Dover just as Mrs. Veal was expiring. Mrs.\n",
       "Bargrave, asked her, whether she would drink some tea. Says Mrs. Veal,\n",
       "I do not care if I do; but I'll warrant you, this mad fellow (meaning\n",
       "Mrs. Bargrave's husband) has broke all your trinkets. But, says Mrs.\n",
       "Bargrave, I'll get something to drink in for all that; but Mrs. Veal\n",
       "waived it, and said, It is no matter, let it alone; and so it passed.\n",
       "\n",
       "All the time I sat with Mrs. Bargrave, which was some hours, she\n",
       "recollected fresh sayings of Mrs. Veal. And one material thing more she\n",
       "told Mrs. Bargrave, that old Mr. Breton allowed Mrs. Veal ten pounds a\n",
       "year; which was a secret, and unknown to Mrs. Bargrave, till Mrs. Veal\n",
       "told it her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Bargrave never varies in her story; which puzzles those who doubt\n",
       "of the truth, or are unwilling to believe it. A servant in the\n",
       "neighbor's yard, adjoining to Mrs. Bargrave's house, heard her talking\n",
       "to somebody an hour of the time Mrs. Veal was with her. Mrs. Bargrave\n",
       "went out to her next neighbor's the very moment she parted with Mrs.\n",
       "Veal, and told her what ravishing conversation she had with an old\n",
       "friend, and told the whole of it. Drelincourt's Book of Death is, since\n",
       "this happened, bought up strangely. And it is to be observed, that\n",
       "notwithstanding all the trouble and fatigue Mrs. Bargrave has undergone\n",
       "upon this account, she never took the value of a farthing, nor suffered\n",
       "her daughter to take anything of anybody, and therefore can have no\n",
       "interest in telling the story.\n",
       "\n",
       "But Mr. Veal does what he can to stifle the matter, and said, he would\n",
       "see Mrs. Bargrave; but yet it is certain matter of fact that he has been\n",
       "at Captain Watson's since the death of his sister, and yet never went\n",
       "near Mrs. Bargrave; and some of his friends report her to be a liar,\n",
       "and that she knew of Mr. Breton's ten pounds a year. But the person who\n",
       "pretends to say so, has the reputation of a notorious liar, among\n",
       "persons whom I know to be of undoubted credit. Now Mr. Veal is more of a\n",
       "gentleman than to say she lies; but says, a bad husband has crazed her.\n",
       "But she needs only present herself, and it will effectually confute that\n",
       "pretense. Mr. Veal says, he asked his sister on her death-bed, whether\n",
       "she had a mind to dispose of anything? And she said, No. Now, the things\n",
       "which Mrs. Veal's apparition would have disposed of, were so trifling,\n",
       "and nothing of justice aimed at in their disposal, that the design of it\n",
       "appears to me to be only in order to make Mrs. Bargrave so to\n",
       "demonstrate the truth of her appearance, as to satisfy the world of the\n",
       "reality thereof, as to what she had seen and heard; and to secure her\n",
       "reputation among the reasonable and understanding part of mankind. And\n",
       "then again, Mr. Veal owns, that there was a purse of gold; but it was\n",
       "not found in her cabinet, but in a comb-box. This looks improbable; for\n",
       "that Mrs. Watson owned, that Mrs. Veal was so very careful of the key of\n",
       "the cabinet, that she would trust nobody with it. And if so, no doubt\n",
       "she would not trust her gold out of it. And Mrs. Veal's often drawing\n",
       "her hand over her eyes, and asking Mrs. Bargrave whether her fits had\n",
       "not impaired her, looks to me as if she did it on purpose to remind Mrs.\n",
       "Bargrave of her fits, to prepare her not to think it strange that she\n",
       "should put her upon writing to her brother to dispose of rings and gold,\n",
       "which looked so much like a dying person's request; and it took\n",
       "accordingly with Mrs. Bargrave, as the effects of her fits coming upon\n",
       "her; and was one of the many instances of her wonderful love to her, and\n",
       "care of her, that she should not be affrighted; which indeed appears in\n",
       "her whole management, particularly in her coming to her in the day-time,\n",
       "waiving the salutation, and when she was alone; and then the manner of\n",
       "her parting, to prevent a second attempt to salute her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, why Mr. Veal should think this relation a reflection, as it is\n",
       "plain he does, by his endeavoring to stifle it, I cannot imagine;\n",
       "because the generality believe her to be a good spirit, her discourse\n",
       "was so heavenly. Her two great errands were to comfort Mrs. Bargrave in\n",
       "her affliction, and to ask her forgiveness for the breach of friendship,\n",
       "and with a pious discourse to encourage her. So that, after all, to\n",
       "suppose that Mrs. Bargrave could hatch such an invention as this from\n",
       "Friday noon till Saturday noon, supposing that she knew of Mrs. Veal's\n",
       "death the very first moment, without jumbling circumstances, and without\n",
       "any interest too; she must be more witty, fortunate, and wicked too,\n",
       "than any indifferent person, I dare say, will allow. I asked Mrs.\n",
       "Bargrave several times, if she was sure she felt the gown? She answered\n",
       "modestly, If my senses be to be relied on, I am sure of it. I asked her,\n",
       "if she heard a sound when she clapped her hand upon her knee? She said,\n",
       "she did not remember she did; but said she appeared to be as much a\n",
       "substance as I did, who talked with her. And I may, said she, be as soon\n",
       "persuaded, that your apparition is talking to me now, as that I did not\n",
       "really see her: for I was under no manner of fear, and received her as a\n",

       "keep herself out of the way as much as she can; and so she has done\n",

       "The origin of the foregoing curious story seems to have been as\n",
       "follows:--\n",
       "\n",
       "An adventurous bookseller had ventured to print a considerable edition\n",
       "of a work by the Reverend Charles Drelincourt, minister of the Calvinist\n",
       "church in Paris, and translated by M. D'Assigny, under the title of \"The\n",
       "Christian's Defense against the Fear of Death, with several directions\n",
       "how to prepare ourselves to die well.\" But however certain the prospect\n",
       "of death, it is not so agreeable (unfortunately) as to invite the eager\n",
       "contemplation of the public; and Drelincourt's book, being neglected,\n",
       "lay a dead stock on the hands of the publisher. In this emergency, he\n",
       "applied to De Foe to assist him (by dint of such means as were then, as\n",
       "well as now, pretty well understood in the literary world) in rescuing\n",
       "the unfortunate book from the literary death to which general neglect\n",
       "seemed about to consign it.\n",
       "\n",
       "De Foe's genius and audacity devised a plan which, for assurance and\n",
       "ingenuity, defied even the powers of Mr. Puff in the _Critic_: for who\n",
       "but himself would have thought of summoning up a ghost from the grave to\n",
       "bear witness in favor of a halting body of divinity? There is a\n",
       "matter-of-fact, business-like style in the whole account of the\n",
       "transaction, which bespeaks ineffable powers of self-possession. The\n",
       "narrative is drawn up \"by a gentleman, a _Justice of Peace_ at\n",
       "Maidstone, in Kent, a very intelligent person.\" And, moreover, \"the\n",
       "discourse is attested by a very sober gentlewoman, who lives in\n",
       "Canterbury, within a few doors of the house in which Mrs. Bargrave\n",
       "lives.\" The Justice believes his kinswoman to be of so discerning a\n",
       "spirit, as not to be put upon by any fallacy--and the kinswoman\n",
       "positively assures the Justice, \"that the whole matter, as it is related\n",
       "and laid down, is really true, and what she herself heard, as near as\n",
       "may be, from Mrs. Bargrave's own mouth, who, she knows, had no reason to\n",
       "invent or publish such a story, or any design to forge and tell a lie,\n",
       "being a woman of so much honesty and virtue, and her whole life a\n",
       "course, as it were, of piety.\" Skepticism itself could not resist this\n",
       "triple court of evidence so artfully combined, the Justice attesting\n",
       "for the discerning spirit of the sober and understanding gentlewoman his\n",

       "have supposed that--although one notorious liar, who is chastised\n",

       "have vouched the fact as universally known, and believed by every one,\n",
       "_nem. con._, would not have been half so satisfactory to a skeptic as to\n",
       "allow fairly that the narrative had been impugned, and hint at the\n",

       "Bargrave had removed to Canterbury, and was residing in a house of her\n",
       "own, when she was suddenly interrupted by a visit from Mrs. Veal, as she\n",
       "was sitting in deep contemplation of certain distresses of her own. The\n",
       "visitor was in a riding-habit, and announced herself as prepared for a\n",
       "distant journey (which seems to intimate that spirits have a\n",
       "considerable distance to go before they arrive at their appointed\n",
       "station, and that the females at least put on a _habit_ for the\n",
       "occasion). The spirit, for such was the seeming Mrs. Veal, continued to\n",
       "waive the ceremony of salutation, both in going and coming, which will\n",

       "Mrs. Veal proses concerning the conversations they had formerly held,\n",
       "and the books they had read together. Her very recent experience\n",
       "probably led Mrs. Veal to talk of death, and the books written on the\n",
       "subject, and she pronounced _ex cathedrá_, as a dead person was best\n",
       "entitled to do, that \"Drelincourt's book on Death was the best book on\n",
       "the subject ever written.\" She also mentioned Dr. Sherlock, two Dutch\n",
       "books which had been translated, and several others; but Drelincourt,\n",
       "she said, had the clearest notions of death and the future state of any\n",
       "who had handled that subject. She then asked for the work [we marvel the\n",
       "edition and impress had not been mentioned] and lectured on it with\n",
       "great eloquence and affection. Dr. Kenrick's _Ascetick_ was also\n",
       "mentioned with approbation by this critical specter [the Doctor's work\n",
       "was no doubt a tenant of the shelf in some favorite publisher's shop];\n",

       "as ridiculous as if the statue of the commander in _Don Juan_ had not\n",
       "only accepted of the invitation of the libertine to supper, but had also\n",
       "committed a beefsteak to his flinty jaws and stomach of adamant. A\n",
       "little more conversation ensued of a less serious nature, and tending to\n",

       "about person and dress somewhat alive. The ghost asked Mrs. Bargrave\n",
       "whether she did not think her very much altered, and Mrs. Bargrave of\n",

       "_scoured silk_, and lately made up. She informed her also of another\n",
       "secret, namely, that one Mr. Breton had allowed her ten pounds a year;\n",
       "and, lastly, she requested that Mrs. Bargrave would write to her\n",
       "brother, and tell him how to distribute her mourning rings, and\n",
       "mentioned there was a purse of gold in her cabinet. She expressed some\n",
       "wish to see Mrs. Bargrave's daughter; but when that good lady went to\n",
       "the next door to seek her, she found on her return the guest leaving the\n",
       "house. She had got without the door, in the street, in the face of the\n",
       "beast market, on a Saturday, which is market day, and stood ready to\n",
       "part. She said she must be going, as she had to call upon her cousin\n",
       "Watson (this appears to be a _gratis dictum_ on the part of the ghost)\n",
       "and, maintaining the character of mortality to the last, she quietly\n",
       "turned the corner, and walked out of sight.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then came the news of Mrs. Veal's having died the day before at noon.\n",
       "Says Mrs. Bargrave, \"I am sure she was with me on Saturday almost two\n",
       "hours.\" And in comes Captain Watson, and says Mrs. Veal was certainly\n",
       "dead. And then come all the pieces of evidence, and especially the\n",
       "striped silk gown. Then Mrs. Watson cried out, \"You have seen her\n",
       "indeed, for none knew but Mrs. Veal and I that that gown was scoured\";\n",
       "and she cried that the gown was described exactly, for, said she, \"I\n",
       "helped her to make it up.\" And next we have the silly attempts made to\n",
       "discredit the history. Even Mr. Veal, her brother, was obliged to allow\n",
       "that the gold was found, but with a difference, and pretended it was not\n",
       "found in a cabinet, but elsewhere; and, in short, we have all the gossip\n",

       "disputed matters usually excite in a country town.\n",
       "\n",
       "When we have thus turned the tale, the seam without, it may be thought\n",

       "told by De Foe himself, will agree that, could the thing have happened\n",
       "in reality, so it would have been told. The sobering the whole\n",
       "supernatural visit into the language of the middle or low life, gives it\n",
       "an air of probability even in its absurdity. The ghost of an exciseman's\n",
       "housekeeper, and a seamstress, were not to converse like Brutus with his\n",
       "Evil Genius. And the circumstances of scoured silks, broken tea-china,\n",

       "conversation, would, one might have thought, be the last which an\n",
       "inventor would have introduced into a pretended narrative betwixt the\n",
       "dead and living. In short, the whole is so distinctly circumstantial,\n",

       "Bagnères-de-Luchon. It was the site of a bishopric until the Revolution,\n",

       "hardly dignify it with the name of city, for there are not a thousand\n",
       "inhabitants. He was a Cambridge man, who had come specially from\n",
       "Toulouse to see St. Bertrand's Church, and had left two friends, who\n",
       "were less keen archæologists than himself, in their hotel at Toulouse,\n",
       "under promise to join him on the following morning. Half an hour at the\n",

       "photographing every corner of the wonderful church that dominates the\n",

       "church-guardians in France, but in a curious furtive, or rather hunted\n",
       "and oppressed, air which he had. He was perpetually half glancing behind\n",
       "him; the muscles of his back and shoulders seemed to be hunched in a\n",
       "continual nervous contraction, as if he were expecting every moment to\n",
       "find himself in the clutch of an enemy. The Englishman hardly knew\n",
       "whether to put him down as a man haunted by a fixed delusion, or as one\n",
       "oppressed by a guilty conscience, or as an unbearably henpecked husband.\n",
       "The probabilities, when reckoned up, certainly pointed to the last idea;\n",

       "They were soon at the house, which was one rather larger than its\n",
       "neighbors, stone-built, with a shield carved over the door, the shield\n",
       "of Alberic de Mauléon, a collateral descendant, Dennistoun tells me, of\n",
       "Bishop John de Mauléon. This Alberic was a Canon of Comminges from 1680\n",
       "to 1701. The upper windows of the mansion were boarded up, and the whole\n",

       "\"Not at all--lots of time--nothing to do till to-morrow. Let us see what\n",

       "The door was opened at this point, and a face looked out, a face far\n",
       "younger than the sacristan's, but bearing something of the same\n",
       "distressing look: only here it seemed to be the mark, not so much of\n",
       "fear for personal safety as of acute anxiety on behalf of another.\n",
       "Plainly, the owner of the face was the sacristan's daughter; and, but\n",
       "for the expression I have described, she was a handsome girl enough. She\n",
       "brightened up considerably on seeing her father accompanied by an\n",
       "able-bodied stranger. A few remarks passed between father and daughter,\n",
       "of which Dennistoun only caught these words, said by the sacristan, \"He\n",
       "was laughing in the church,\" words which were answered only by a look of\n",
       "terror from the girl.\n",
       "\n",
       "But in another minute they were in the sitting-room of the house, a\n",
       "small, high chamber with a stone floor, full of moving shadows cast by a\n",
       "wood-fire that flickered on a great hearth. Something of the character\n",
       "of an oratory was imparted to it by a tall crucifix, which reached\n",
       "almost to the ceiling on one side; the figure was painted of the natural\n",
       "colors, the cross was black. Under this stood a chest of some age and\n",
       "solidity, and when a lamp had been brought, and chairs set, the\n",
       "sacristan went to this chest, and produced therefrom, with growing\n",
       "excitement and nervousness, as Dennistoun thought, a large book wrapped\n",
       "in a white cloth, on which cloth a cross was rudely embroidered in red\n",
       "thread. Even before the wrapping had been removed, Dennistoun began to\n",
       "be interested by the size and shape of the volume. \"Too large for a\n",
       "missal,\" he thought, \"and not the shape of an antiphoner; perhaps it may\n",
       "be something good, after all.\" The next moment the book was open, and\n",
       "Dennistoun felt that he had at last lit upon something better than good.\n",
       "Before him lay a large folio, bound, perhaps, late in the seventeenth\n",
       "century, with the arms of Canon Alberic de Mauléon stamped in gold on\n",
       "the sides. There may have been a hundred and fifty leaves of paper in\n",
       "the book, and on almost every one of them was fastened a leaf from an\n",
       "illuminated manuscript. Such a collection Dennistoun had hardly dreamed\n",
       "of in his wildest moments. Here were ten leaves from a copy of Genesis,\n",
       "illustrated with pictures, which could not be later than 700 A.D.\n",
       "Further on was a complete set of pictures from a psalter, of English\n",
       "execution, of the very finest kind that the thirteenth century could\n",
       "produce; and, perhaps best of all, there were twenty leaves of uncial\n",
       "writing in Latin, which, as a few words seen here and there told him at\n",
       "once, must belong to some very early unknown patristic treatise. Could\n",
       "it possibly be a fragment of the copy of Papias \"On the Words of Our\n",
       "Lord,\" which was known to have existed as late as the twelfth century at\n",
       "Nîmes?[A] In any case, his mind was made up; that book must return to\n",
       "Cambridge with him, even if he had to draw the whole of his balance from\n",
       "the bank and stay at St. Bertrand till the money came. He glanced up at\n",
       "the sacristan to see if his face yielded any hint that the book was for\n",
       "sale. The sacristan was pale, and his lips were working.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If monsieur will turn on to the end,\" he said.\n",
       "\n",
       "So monsieur turned on, meeting new treasures at every rise of a leaf;\n",
       "and at the end of the book he came upon two sheets of paper, of much\n",
       "more recent date than anything he had yet seen, which puzzled him\n",
       "considerably. They must be contemporary, he decided, with the\n",
       "unprincipled Canon Alberic, who had doubtless plundered the Chapter\n",
       "library of St. Bertrand to form this priceless scrapbook. On the first\n",
       "of the paper sheets was a plan, carefully drawn and instantly\n",
       "recognizable by a person who knew the ground, of the south aisle and\n",
       "cloisters of St. Bertrand's. There were curious signs looking like\n",
       "planetary symbols, and a few Hebrew words in the corners; and in the\n",
       "northwest angle of the cloister was a cross drawn in gold paint. Below\n",

       "What he then saw impressed him, as he has often told me, more than he\n",
       "could have conceived any drawing or picture capable of impressing him.\n",
       "And, though the drawing he saw is no longer in existence, there is a\n",
       "photograph of it (which I possess) which fully bears out that statement.\n",
       "The picture in question was a sepia drawing at the end of the\n",
       "seventeenth century, representing, one would say at first sight, a\n",
       "Biblical scene; for the architecture (the picture represented an\n",
       "interior) and the figures had that semi-classical flavor about them\n",
       "which the artists of two hundred years ago thought appropriate to\n",
       "illustrations of the Bible. On the right was a king on his throne, the\n",
       "throne elevated on twelve steps, a canopy overhead, soldiers on either\n",
       "side--evidently King Solomon. He was bending forward with outstretched\n",
       "scepter, in attitude of command; his face expressed horror and disgust,\n",
       "yet there was in it also the mark of imperious command and confident\n",
       "power. The left half of the picture was the strangest, however. The\n",
       "interest plainly centered there. On the pavement before the throne were\n",
       "grouped four soldiers, surrounding a crouching figure which must be\n",
       "described in a moment. A fifth soldier lay dead on the pavement, his\n",
       "neck distorted, and his eyeballs starting from his head. The four\n",
       "surrounding guards were looking at the King. In their faces the\n",
       "sentiment of horror was intensified; they seemed, in fact, only\n",
       "restrained from flight by their implicit trust in their master. All this\n",
       "terror was plainly excited by the being that crouched in their midst.\n",
       "I entirely despair of conveying by any words the impression which this\n",
       "figure makes upon any one who looks at it. I recollect once showing the\n",
       "photograph of the drawing to a lecturer on morphology--a person of, I\n",
       "was going to say, abnormally sane and unimaginative habits of mind. He\n",
       "absolutely refused to be alone for the rest of that evening, and he told\n",
       "me afterwards that for many nights he had not dared to put out his light\n",
       "before going to sleep. However, the main traits of the figure I can at\n",
       "least indicate. At first you saw only a mass of coarse, matted black\n",
       "hair; presently it was seen that this covered a body of fearful\n",
       "thinness, almost a skeleton, but with the muscles standing out like\n",
       "wires. The hands were of a dusky pallor, covered, like the body, with\n",
       "long, coarse hairs, and hideously taloned. The eyes, touched in with a\n",
       "burning yellow, had intensely black pupils, and were fixed upon the\n",
       "throned king with a look of beast-like hate. Imagine one of the awful\n",
       "bird-catching spiders of South America translated into human form, and\n",
       "endowed with intelligence just less than human, and you will have some\n",
       "faint conception of the terror inspired by the appalling effigy. One\n",
       "remark is universally made by those to whom I have shown the picture:\n",

       "\n",
       "As soon as the first shock of his irresistible fright had subsided,\n",

       "upon his eyes; his daughter, looking up at the cross on the wall, was\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Certainly, certainly,\" said Dennistoun, who was impatient to examine\n",

       "under his arm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here he was met by the daughter; she, it appeared, was anxious to do a\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Nothing--nothing in the world. Monsieur is more than welcome to it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The tone in which this and much more was said was unmistakably genuine,\n",
       "so that Dennistoun was reduced to profuse thanks, and submitted to have\n",
       "the chain put round his neck. It really seemed as if he had rendered the\n",
       "father and daughter some service which they hardly knew how to repay. As\n",
       "he set off with his book they stood at the door looking after him, and\n",
       "they were still looking when he waved them a last good-night from the\n",
       "steps of the Chapeau Rouge.\n",
       "\n",
       "Dinner was over, and Dennistoun was in his bedroom, shut up alone with\n",
       "his acquisition. The landlady had manifested a particular interest in\n",
       "him since he had told her that he had paid a visit to the sacristan and\n",
       "bought an old book from him. He thought, too, that he had heard a\n",
       "hurried dialogue between her and the said sacristan in the passage\n",
       "outside the _salle à manger_; some words to the effect that \"Pierre and\n",
       "Bertrand would be sleeping in the house\" had closed the conversation.\n",
       "\n",
       "At this time a growing feeling of discomfort had been creeping over\n",
       "him--nervous reaction, perhaps, after the delight of his discovery.\n",
       "Whatever it was, it resulted in a conviction that there was some one\n",
       "behind him, and that he was far more comfortable with his back to the\n",
       "wall. All this, of course, weighed light in the balance as against the\n",
       "obvious value of the collection he had acquired. And now, as I said, he\n",
       "was alone in his bedroom, taking stock of Canon Alberic's treasures, in\n",
       "which every moment revealed something more charming.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Bless Canon Alberic!\" said Dennistoun, who had an inveterate habit of\n",
       "talking to himself. \"I wonder where he is now? Dear me! I wish that\n",
       "landlady would learn to laugh in a more cheering manner; it makes one\n",
       "feel as if there was some one dead in the house. Half a pipe more, did\n",
       "you say? I think perhaps you are right. I wonder what that crucifix is\n",
       "that the young woman insisted on giving me? Last century, I suppose.\n",
       "Yes, probably. It is rather a nuisance of a thing to have round one's\n",
       "neck--just too heavy. Most likely her father had been wearing it for\n",
       "years. I think I might give it a clean up before I put it away.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He had taken the crucifix off, and laid it on the table, when his\n",
       "attention was caught by an object lying on the red cloth just by his\n",
       "left elbow. Two or three ideas of what it might be flitted through his\n",

       "\n",
       "\"A penwiper? No, no such thing in the house. A rat? No, too black. A\n",

       "the ends of the fingers and curving sharply down and forward, gray,\n",
       "horny and wrinkled.\n",
       "\n",
       "He flew out of his chair with deadly, inconceivable terror clutching at\n",
       "his heart. The shape, whose left hand rested on the table, was rising to\n",
       "a standing posture behind his seat, its right hand crooked above his\n",
       "scalp. There was black and tattered drapery about it; the coarse hair\n",
       "covered it as in the drawing. The lower jaw was thin--what can I call\n",
       "it?--shallow, like a beast's; teeth showed behind the black lips; there\n",
       "was no nose; the eyes, of a fiery yellow, against which the pupils\n",
       "showed black and intense, and the exulting hate and thirst to destroy\n",
       "life which shone there, were the most horrifying feature in the whole\n",

       "\n",
       "The feelings which this horror stirred in Dennistoun were the intensest\n",

       "What could he do? He has never been quite certain what words he said,\n",
       "but he knows that he spoke, that he grasped blindly at the silver\n",
       "crucifix, that he was conscious of a movement towards him on the part of\n",

       "A friend of mine, who is a man of letters and a philosopher, said to me\n",
       "one day, as if between jest and earnest,--\"Fancy! since we last met, I\n",
       "have discovered a haunted house in the midst of London.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Really haunted?--and by what? ghosts?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, I can't answer that question: all I know is this--six weeks ago\n",
       "my wife and I were in search of a furnished apartment. Passing a quiet\n",
       "street, we saw on the window of one of the houses a bill, 'Apartments\n",
       "Furnished.' The situation suited us; we entered the house--liked the\n",
       "rooms--engaged them by the week--and left them the third day. No power\n",
       "on earth could have reconciled my wife to stay longer; and I don't\n",
       "wonder at it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What did you see?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Excuse me--I have no desire to be ridiculed as a superstitious\n",
       "dreamer--nor, on the other hand, could I ask you to accept on my\n",
       "affirmation what you would hold to be incredible without the evidence of\n",
       "your own senses. Let me only say this, it was not so much what we saw or\n",
       "heard (in which you might fairly suppose that we were the dupes of our\n",
       "own excited fancy, or the victims of imposture in others) that drove us\n",
       "away, as it was an undefinable terror which seized both of us whenever\n",
       "we passed by the door of a certain unfurnished room, in which we neither\n",
       "saw nor heard anything. And the strangest marvel of all was, that for\n",
       "once in my life I agreed with my wife, silly woman though she be--and\n",
       "allowed, after the third night, that it was impossible to stay a fourth\n",
       "in that house. Accordingly, on the fourth morning I summoned the woman\n",
       "who kept the house and attended on us, and told her that the rooms did\n",
       "not quite suit us, and we would not stay out our week. She said, dryly,\n",
       "'I know why: you have stayed longer than any other lodger. Few ever\n",
       "stayed a second night; none before you a third. But I take it they have\n",
       "been very kind to you.'\n",
       "\n",
       "\"'They--who?' I asked, affecting to smile.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"'Why, they who haunt the house, whoever they are. I don't mind them;\n",
       "I remember them many years ago, when I lived in this house, not as a\n",
       "servant; but I know they will be the death of me some day. I don't\n",
       "care--I'm old, and must die soon anyhow; and then I shall be with them,\n",
       "and in this house still.' The woman spoke with so dreary a calmness,\n",
       "that really it was a sort of awe that prevented my conversing with her\n",
       "further. I paid for my week, and too happy were my wife and I to get off\n",
       "so cheaply.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You excite my curiosity,\" said I; \"nothing I should like better than to\n",
       "sleep in a haunted house. Pray give me the address of the one which you\n",
       "left so ignominiously.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "My friend gave me the address; and when we parted, I walked straight\n",
       "towards the house thus indicated.\n",
       "\n",
       "It is situated on the North side of Oxford Street (in a dull but\n",
       "respectable thoroughfare). I found the house shut up--no bill at the\n",
       "window, and no response to my knock. As I was turning away, a beer-boy,\n",
       "collecting pewter pots at the neighboring areas, said to me, \"Do you\n",
       "want any one at that house, sir?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, I heard it was to be let.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Let!--why, the woman who kept it is dead--has been dead these three\n",
       "weeks, and no one can be found to stay there, though Mr. J---- offered\n",
       "ever so much. He offered mother, who chars for him, £1 a week just to\n",
       "open and shut the windows, and she would not.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Would not!--and why?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The house is haunted: and the old woman who kept it was found dead in\n",
       "her bed, with her eyes wide open. They say the devil strangled her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Pooh!--you speak of Mr. J----. Is he the owner of the house?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Where does he live?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"In G---- Street, No. --.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What is he?--in any business?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, sir--nothing particular; a single gentleman.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "I gave the pot-boy the gratuity earned by his liberal information, and\n",
       "proceeded to Mr. J----, in G---- Street, which was close by the street\n",
       "that boasted the haunted house. I was lucky enough to find Mr. J---- at\n",
       "home--an elderly man, with intelligent countenance and prepossessing\n",
       "manners.\n",
       "\n",
       "I communicated my name and my business frankly. I said I heard the house\n",
       "was considered to be haunted--that I had a strong desire to examine a\n",
       "house with so equivocal a reputation--that I should be greatly obliged\n",
       "if he would allow me to hire it, though only for a night. I was willing\n",
       "to pay for that privilege whatever he might be inclined to ask. \"Sir,\"\n",
       "said Mr. J----, with great courtesy, \"the house is at your service, for\n",
       "as short or as long a time as you please. Rent is out of the\n",
       "question--the obligation will be on my side should you be able to\n",
       "discover the cause of the strange phenomena which at present deprive it\n",
       "of all value. I cannot let it, for I cannot even get a servant to keep\n",
       "it in order or answer the door. Unluckily the house is haunted, if I may\n",
       "use that expression, not only by night, but by day; though at night the\n",
       "disturbances are of a more unpleasant and sometimes of a more alarming\n",
       "character. The poor old woman who died in it three weeks ago was a\n",
       "pauper whom I took out of a workhouse, for in her childhood she had been\n",
       "known to some of my family, and had once been in such good circumstances\n",
       "that she had rented that house of my uncle. She was a woman of superior\n",
       "education and strong mind, and was the only person I could ever induce\n",
       "to remain in the house. Indeed, since her death, which was sudden, and\n",
       "the coroner's inquest, which gave it a notoriety in the neighborhood,\n",
       "I have so despaired of finding any person to take charge of the house,\n",
       "much more a tenant, that I would willingly let it rent-free for a year\n",
       "to any one who would pay its rates and taxes.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How long is it since the house acquired this sinister character?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That I can scarcely tell you, but very many years since. The old woman\n",
       "I spoke of said it was haunted when she rented it between thirty and\n",
       "forty years ago. The fact is, that my life has been spent in the East\n",
       "Indies, and in the civil service of the Company. I returned to England\n",
       "last year, on inheriting the fortune of an uncle, among whose\n",
       "possessions was the house in question. I found it shut up and\n",
       "uninhabited. I was told that it was haunted, that no one would inhabit\n",
       "it. I smiled at what seemed to me so idle a story. I spent some money in\n",
       "repairing it--added to its old-fashioned furniture a few modern\n",
       "articles--advertised it, and obtained a lodger for a year. He was a\n",
       "colonel retired on half-pay. He came in with his family, a son and a\n",
       "daughter, and four or five servants: they all left the house the next\n",
       "day; and, although each of them declared that he had seen something\n",
       "different from that which had scared the others, a something still was\n",
       "equally terrible to all. I really could not in conscience sue, nor even\n",
       "blame, the colonel for breach of agreement. Then I put in the old woman\n",
       "I have spoken of, and she was empowered to let the house in apartments.\n",
       "I never had one lodger who stayed more than three days. I do not tell\n",
       "you their stories--to no two lodgers have there been exactly the same\n",
       "phenomena repeated. It is better that you should judge for yourself,\n",
       "than enter the house with an imagination influenced by previous\n",
       "narratives; only be prepared to see and to hear something or other, and\n",
       "take whatever precautions you yourself please.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Have you never had a curiosity yourself to pass a night in that house?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes. I passed not a night, but three hours in broad daylight alone in\n",
       "that house. My curiosity is not satisfied but it is quenched. I have no\n",
       "desire to renew the experiment. You cannot complain, you see, sir, that\n",
       "I am not sufficiently candid; and unless your interest be exceedingly\n",
       "eager and your nerves unusually strong, I honestly add, that I advise\n",
       "you not to pass a night in that house.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My interest _is_ exceedingly keen,\" said I, \"and though only a coward\n",
       "will boast of his nerves in situations wholly unfamiliar to him, yet my\n",
       "nerves have been seasoned in such variety of danger that I have the\n",
       "right to rely on them--even in a haunted house.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. J---- said very little more; he took the keys of the house out of\n",
       "his bureau, gave them to me--and, thanking him cordially for his\n",
       "frankness, and his urbane concession to my wish, I carried off my prize.\n",
       "\n",
       "Impatient for the experiment, as soon as I reached home, I summoned my\n",
       "confidential servant--a young man of gay spirits, fearless temper, and\n",
       "as free from superstitious prejudices as any one I could think of.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"F----,\" said I, \"you remember in Germany how disappointed we were at\n",
       "not finding a ghost in that old castle, which was said to be haunted by\n",
       "a headless apparition? Well, I have heard of a house in London which,\n",
       "I have reason to hope, is decidedly haunted. I mean to sleep there\n",
       "to-night. From what I hear, there is no doubt that something will allow\n",
       "itself to be seen or to be heard--something, perhaps, excessively\n",
       "horrible. Do you think if I take you with me, I may rely on your\n",
       "presence of mind, whatever may happen?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, sir! pray trust me,\" answered F----, grinning with delight.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very well; then here are the keys of the house--this is the address. Go\n",
       "now--select for me any bedroom you please; and since the house has not\n",
       "been inhabited for weeks, make up a good fire--air the bed well--see, of\n",
       "course, that there are candles as well as fuel. Take with you my\n",
       "revolver and my dagger--so much for my weapons--arm yourself equally\n",
       "well; and if we are not a match for a dozen ghosts, we shall be but a\n",
       "sorry couple of Englishmen.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "I was engaged for the rest of the day on business so urgent that I had\n",
       "not leisure to think much on the nocturnal adventure to which I had\n",
       "plighted my honor. I dined alone, and very late, and while dining, read,\n",
       "as is my habit. I selected one of the volumes of Macaulay's Essays.\n",
       "I thought to myself that I would take the book with me; there was so\n",
       "much of the healthfulness in the style, and practical life in the\n",
       "subjects, that it would serve as an antidote against the influence of\n",
       "superstitious fancy.\n",
       "\n",
       "Accordingly, about half-past nine, I put the book into my pocket, and\n",
       "strolled leisurely towards the haunted house. I took with me a favorite\n",
       "dog--an exceedingly sharp, bold and vigilant bull-terrier--a dog fond of\n",
       "prowling about strange ghostly corners and passages at night in search\n",
       "of rats--a dog of dogs for a ghost.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was a summer night, but chilly, the sky somewhat gloomy and overcast.\n",
       "Still there was a moon--faint and sickly, but still a moon--and if the\n",
       "clouds permitted, after midnight it would be brighter.\n",
       "\n",
       "I reached the house, knocked, and my servant opened with a cheerful\n",
       "smile.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"All right, sir, and very comfortable.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh!\" said I, rather disappointed; \"have you not seen nor heard anything\n",
       "remarkable?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, sir, I must own I have heard something queer.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What?--what?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The sound of feet pattering behind me; and once or twice small noises\n",
       "like whispers close at my ear--nothing more.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are not at all frightened?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I! not a bit of it, sir,\" and the man's bold look reassured me on one\n",
       "point--viz., that happen what might, he would not desert me.\n",
       "\n",
       "We were in the hall, the street-door closed, and my attention was now\n",
       "drawn to my dog. He had at first run in eagerly enough, but had sneaked\n",
       "back to the door, and was scratching and whining to get out. After\n",
       "patting him on the head, and encouraging him gently, the dog seemed to\n",
       "reconcile himself to the situation, and followed me and F---- through\n",
       "the house, but keeping close at my heels instead of hurrying\n",
       "inquisitively in advance, which was his usual and normal habit in all\n",
       "strange places. We first visited the subterranean apartments, the\n",
       "kitchen and other offices, and especially the cellars, in which last\n",
       "there were two or three bottles of wine still left in a bin, covered\n",
       "with cobwebs, and evidently, by their appearance, undisturbed for many\n",
       "years. It was clear that the ghosts were not wine-bibbers. For the rest\n",
       "we discovered nothing of interest. There was a gloomy little backyard\n",
       "with very high walls. The stones of this yard were very damp; and what\n",
       "with the damp, and what with the dust and smoke-grime on the pavement,\n",
       "our feet left a slight impression where we passed.\n",
       "\n",
       "And now appeared the first strange phenomenon witnessed by myself in\n",
       "this strange abode. I saw, just before me, the print of a foot suddenly\n",
       "form itself, as it were. I stopped, caught hold of my servant, and\n",
       "pointed to it. In advance of that footprint as suddenly dropped another.\n",
       "We both saw it. I advanced quickly to the place; the footprint kept\n",
       "advancing before me, a small footprint--the foot of a child; the\n",
       "impression was too faint thoroughly to distinguish the shape, but it\n",
       "seemed to us both that it was the print of a naked foot. This phenomenon\n",
       "ceased when we arrived at the opposite wall, nor did it repeat itself on\n",
       "returning. We remounted the stairs, and entered the rooms on the ground\n",
       "floor, a dining-parlor, a small back parlor, and a still smaller third\n",
       "room that had been probably appropriated to a footman--all still as\n",
       "death. We then visited the drawing-rooms, which seemed fresh and new. In\n",
       "the front room I seated myself in an armchair. F---- placed on the table\n",
       "the candlestick with which he had lighted us. I told him to shut the\n",
       "door. As he turned to do so, a chair opposite to me moved from the wall\n",
       "quickly and noiselessly, and dropped itself about a yard from my own\n",
       "chair, immediately fronting it.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why, this is better than the turning tables,\" said I, with a\n",
       "half-laugh; and as I laughed, my dog put back his head and howled.\n",
       "\n",
       "F----, coming back, had not observed the movement of the chair. He\n",
       "employed himself now in stilling the dog. I continued to gaze on the\n",
       "chair, and fancied I saw on it a pale blue misty outline of a human\n",
       "figure, but an outline so indistinct that I could only distrust my own\n",
       "vision. The dog now was quiet.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Put back that chair opposite me,\" said I to F----; \"put it back to the\n",
       "wall.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "F---- obeyed. \"Was that you, sir?\" said he, turning abruptly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I!--what?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why, something struck me. I felt it sharply on the shoulder--just\n",
       "here.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No,\" said I. \"But we have jugglers present, and though we may not\n",
       "discover their tricks, we shall catch _them_ before they frighten _us_.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "We did not stay long in the drawing-rooms--in fact, they felt so damp\n",
       "and so chilly that I was glad to get to the fire upstairs. We locked the\n",
       "doors of the drawing-rooms--a precaution which, I should observe, we had\n",
       "taken with all the rooms we had searched below. The bedroom my servant\n",
       "had selected for me was the best on the floor--a large one, with two\n",
       "windows fronting the street. The four-posted bed, which took up no\n",
       "inconsiderable space, was opposite to the fire, which burnt clear and\n",
       "bright; a door in the wall to the left, between the bed and the window,\n",
       "communicated with the room which my servant appropriated to himself.\n",
       "This last was a small room with a sofa-bed, and had no communication\n",
       "with the landing-place--no other door but that which conducted to the\n",
       "bedroom I was to occupy. On either side of my fireplace was a cupboard,\n",
       "without locks, flush with the wall and covered with the same dull-brown\n",
       "paper. We examined these cupboards--only hooks to suspend female\n",
       "dresses--nothing else; we sounded the walls--evidently solid--the outer\n",
       "walls of the building. Having finished the survey of these apartments,\n",
       "warmed myself a few moments, and lighted my cigar, I then, still\n",
       "accompanied by F----, went forth to complete my reconnoiter. In the\n",
       "landing-place there was another door; it was closed firmly. \"Sir,\" said\n",
       "my servant, in surprise, \"I unlocked this door with all the others when\n",
       "I first came; it cannot have got locked from the inside, for----\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Before he had finished his sentence, the door, which neither of us then\n",
       "was touching, opened quietly of itself. We looked at each other a single\n",
       "instant. The same thought seized both--some human agency might be\n",
       "detected here. I rushed in first, my servant followed. A small blank\n",
       "dreary room without furniture--few empty boxes and hampers in a\n",
       "corner--a small window--the shutters closed--not even a fireplace--no\n",
       "other door than that by which we had entered--no carpet on the floor,\n",
       "and the floor seemed very old, uneven, worm-eaten, mended here and\n",
       "there, as was shown by the whiter patches on the wood; but no living\n",
       "being, and no visible place in which a living being could have hidden.\n",
       "As we stood gazing round, the door by which we had entered closed as\n",
       "quietly as it had before opened: we were imprisoned.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the first time I felt a creep of undefinable horror. Not so my\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Try first if it will open to your hand,\" said I, shaking off the vague\n",
       "apprehension that had seized me, \"while I unclose the shutters and see\n",
       "what is without.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "I unbarred the shutters--the window looked on the little back yard I\n",
       "have before described; there was no ledge without--nothing to break the\n",

       "circumstances so extraordinary, compelled my admiration, and made me\n",

       "the occasion. I willingly gave him the permission he required. But\n",
       "though he was a remarkably strong man, his force was as idle as his\n",
       "milder efforts; the door did not even shake to his stoutest kick.\n",
       "Breathless and panting, he desisted. I then tried the door myself,\n",
       "equally in vain. As I ceased from the effort, again that creep of horror\n",
       "came over me; but this time it was more cold and stubborn. I felt as if\n",
       "some strange and ghastly exhalation were rising up from the chinks of\n",
       "that rugged floor, and filling the atmosphere with a venomous influence\n",
       "hostile to human life. The door now very slowly and quietly opened as\n",
       "of its own accord. We precipitated ourselves into the landing-place. We\n",
       "both saw a large pale light--as large as the human figure but shapeless\n",
       "and unsubstantial--move before us, and ascend the stairs that led from\n",
       "the landing into the attics. I followed the light, and my servant\n",
       "followed me. It entered, to the right of the landing, a small garret, of\n",
       "which the door stood open. I entered in the same instant. The light then\n",
       "collapsed into a small globule, exceedingly brilliant and vivid; rested\n",
       "a moment on a bed in the corner, quivered, and vanished.\n",
       "\n",
       "We approached the bed and examined it--a half-tester, such as is\n",
       "commonly found in attics devoted to servants. On the drawers that stood\n",
       "near it we perceived an old faded silk kerchief, with the needle still\n",
       "left in a rent half repaired. The kerchief was covered with dust;\n",
       "probably it had belonged to the old woman who had last died in that\n",
       "house, and this might have been her sleeping room. I had sufficient\n",
       "curiosity to open the drawers: there were a few odds and ends of female\n",
       "dress, and two letters tied round with a narrow ribbon of faded yellow.\n",
       "I took the liberty to possess myself of the letters. We found nothing\n",
       "else in the room worth noticing--nor did the light reappear; but we\n",
       "distinctly heard, as we turned to go, a pattering footfall on the\n",
       "floor--just before us. We went through the other attics (in all four),\n",
       "the footfall still preceding us. Nothing to be seen--nothing but the\n",
       "footfall heard. I had the letters in my hand: just as I was descending\n",
       "the stairs I distinctly felt my wrist seized, and a faint soft effort\n",
       "made to draw the letters from my clasp. I only held them the more\n",
       "tightly, and the effort ceased.\n",
       "\n",
       "We regained the bedchamber appropriated to myself, and I then remarked\n",
       "that my dog had not followed us when we had left it. He was thrusting\n",
       "himself close to the fire, and trembling. I was impatient to examine the\n",
       "letters; and while I read them, my servant opened a little box in which\n",
       "he had deposited the weapons I had ordered him to bring; took them out,\n",
       "placed them on a table close at my bed-head, and then occupied himself\n",
       "in soothing the dog, who, however, seemed to heed him very little.\n",
       "\n",
       "The letters were short--they were dated; the dates exactly thirty-five\n",
       "years ago. They were evidently from a lover to his mistress, or a\n",
       "husband to some young wife. Not only the terms of expression, but a\n",
       "distinct reference to a former voyage, indicated the writer to have been\n",
       "a seafarer. The spelling and handwriting were those of a man imperfectly\n",
       "educated, but still the language itself was forcible. In the expressions\n",
       "of endearment there was a kind of rough wild love; but here and there\n",
       "were dark and unintelligible hints at some secret not of love--some\n",
       "secret that seemed of crime. \"We ought to love each other,\" was one of\n",
       "the sentences I remember, \"for how every one else would execrate us if\n",
       "all was known.\" Again: \"Don't let any one be in the same room with you\n",
       "at night--you talk in your sleep.\" And again: \"What's done can't be\n",
       "undone; and I tell you there's nothing against us unless the dead could\n",
       "come to life.\" Here there was underlined in a better handwriting (a\n",
       "female's), \"They do!\" At the end of the letter latest in date the same\n",
       "female hand had written these words: \"Lost at sea the 4th of June, the\n",
       "same day as ----.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "I put down the letters, and began to muse over their contents.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fearing, however, that the train of thought into which I fell might\n",
       "unsteady my nerves, I fully determined to keep my mind in a fit state to\n",
       "cope with whatever of marvelous the advancing night might bring forth.\n",
       "I roused myself--laid the letters on the table--stirred up the fire,\n",
       "which was still bright and cheering--and opened my volume of Macaulay.\n",
       "I read quietly enough till about half-past eleven. I then threw myself\n",
       "dressed upon the bed, and told my servant he might retire to his own\n",
       "room, but must keep himself awake. I bade him leave open the door between\n",
       "the two rooms. Thus alone, I kept two candles burning on the table by my\n",
       "bed-head. I placed my watch beside the weapons, and calmly resumed my\n",
       "Macaulay. Opposite to me the fire burned clear; and on the hearthrug,\n",
       "seemingly asleep, lay the dog. In about twenty minutes I felt an\n",
       "exceedingly cold air pass by my cheek, like a sudden draught. I fancied\n",
       "the door to my right, communicating with the landing-place, must have\n",
       "got open; but no--it was closed. I then turned my glance to my left, and\n",
       "saw the flame of the candles violently swayed as by a wind. At the same\n",
       "moment the watch beside the revolver softly slid from the table--softly,\n",
       "softly--no visible hand--it was gone. I sprang up, seizing the revolver\n",
       "with the one hand, the dagger with other: I was not willing that my\n",
       "weapons should share the fate of the watch. Thus armed, I looked round\n",
       "the floor--no sign of the watch. Three slow, loud, distinct knocks were\n",
       "now heard at the bed-head; my servant called out, \"Is that you, sir?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No; be on your guard.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The dog now roused himself and sat on his haunches, his ears moving\n",
       "quickly backwards and forwards. He kept his eyes fixed on me with a look\n",
       "so strange that he concentered all my attention on himself. Slowly he\n",
       "rose up, all his hair bristling, and stood perfectly rigid, and with the\n",
       "same wild stare. I had no time, however, to examine the dog. Presently\n",
       "my servant emerged from his room; and if ever I saw horror in the human\n",
       "face, it was then. I should not have recognized him had we met in the\n",
       "street, so altered was every lineament. He passed by me quickly, saying\n",
       "in a whisper that seemed scarcely to come from his lips, \"Run--run! it\n",
       "is after me!\" He gained the door to the landing, pulled it open, and\n",
       "rushed forth. I followed him into the landing involuntarily, calling him\n",
       "to stop; but, without heeding me, he bounded down the stairs, clinging\n",
       "to the balusters, and taking several steps at a time. I heard, where I\n",
       "stood, the street-door open--heard it again clap to. I was left alone in\n",
       "the haunted house.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was but for a moment that I remained undecided whether or not to\n",
       "follow my servant; pride and curiosity alike forbade so dastardly a\n",
       "flight. I re-entered my room, closing the door after me, and proceeded\n",
       "cautiously into the interior chamber. I encountered nothing to justify\n",
       "my servant's terror. I again carefully examined the walls, to see if\n",
       "there were any concealed door. I could find no trace of one--not even a\n",
       "seam in the dull-brown paper with which the room was hung. How, then,\n",
       "had the THING, whatever it was, which had so scared him, obtained\n",
       "ingress except through my own chamber?\n",
       "\n",
       "I returned to my room, shut and locked the door that opened upon the\n",
       "interior one, and stood on the hearth, expectant and prepared. I now\n",
       "perceived that the dog had slunk into an angle of the wall, and was\n",
       "pressing himself close against it, as if literally striving to force his\n",
       "way into it. I approached the animal and spoke to it; the poor brute was\n",
       "evidently beside itself with terror. It showed all its teeth, the slaver\n",
       "dropping from its jaws, and would certainly have bitten me if I had\n",
       "touched it. It did not seem to recognize me. Whoever has seen at the\n",
       "Zoological Gardens a rabbit fascinated by a serpent, cowering in a\n",
       "corner, may form some idea of the anguish which the dog exhibited.\n",
       "Finding all efforts to soothe the animal in vain, and fearing that his\n",
       "bite might be as venomous in that state as in the madness of\n",
       "hydrophobia, I left him alone, placed my weapons on the table beside the\n",
       "fire, seated myself, and recommenced my Macaulay.\n",
       "\n",
       "Perhaps, in order not to appear seeking credit for a courage, or rather\n",
       "a coolness, which the reader may conceive I exaggerate, I may be\n",
       "pardoned if I pause to indulge in one or two egotistical remarks.\n",
       "\n",
       "As I hold presence of mind, or what is called courage, to be precisely\n",
       "proportioned to familiarity with the circumstances that lead to it, so I\n",
       "should say that I had been long sufficiently familiar with all\n",
       "experiments that appertain to the Marvelous. I had witnessed many very\n",
       "extraordinary phenomena in various parts of the world--phenomena that\n",
       "would be either totally disbelieved if I stated them, or ascribed to\n",
       "supernatural agencies. Now, my theory is that the Supernatural is the\n",
       "Impossible, and that what is called supernatural is only a something in\n",
       "the laws of nature of which we have been hitherto ignorant. Therefore,\n",
       "if a ghost rise before me, I have not the right to say, \"So, then, the\n",
       "supernatural is possible,\" but rather, \"So, then, the apparition of a\n",

       "magicians who assert that they can raise spirits. Assume for the moment\n",
       "that they assert truly, still the living material form of the magician\n",

       "in all such marvels, supposing even that there is no imposture, there\n",
       "must be a human being like ourselves by whom, or through whom, the\n",
       "effects presented to human beings are produced. It is so with the now\n",
       "familiar phenomena of mesmerism or electro-biology; the mind of the\n",
       "person operated on is affected through a material living agent. Nor,\n",
       "supposing it true that a mesmerized patient can respond to the will or\n",

       "\n",
       "As, then, it was my conjecture that all that was presented, or would be\n",

       "constitution with the power so to present them, and having some motive\n",
       "so to do, I felt an interest in my theory which, in its way, was rather\n",

       "as tranquil a temper for observation as any practical experimentalist\n",

       "\n",
       "It was a Darkness shaping itself forth from the air in very undefined\n",

       "resemblance to a human form, or rather shadow, than to anything else. As\n",
       "it stood, wholly apart and distinct from the air and the light around\n",
       "it, its dimensions seemed gigantic, the summit nearly touching the\n",
       "ceiling. While I gazed, a feeling of intense cold seized me. An iceberg\n",

       "iceberg have been more purely physical. I feel convinced that it was not\n",

       "\n",
       "I strove to speak--my voice utterly failed me; I could only think\n",
       "to myself, \"is this fear? it is _not_ fear!\" I strove to rise--in\n",
       "vain; I felt as if weighed down by an irresistible force. Indeed, my\n",
       "impression was that of an immense and overwhelming Power opposed to any\n",
       "volition;--that sense of utter inadequacy to cope with a force beyond\n",
       "man's, which one may feel _physically_ in a storm at sea, in a\n",
       "conflagration, or when confronting some terrible wild beast, or rather,\n",
       "perhaps, the shark of the ocean, I felt _morally_. Opposed to my will\n",

       "And now, as this impression grew on me--now came, at last,\n",
       "horror--horror to a degree that no words can convey. Still I retained\n",
       "pride, if not courage; and in my own mind I said, \"This is horror, but\n",

       "thing, it is an illusion--I do not fear.\" With a violent effort I\n",

       "light began slowly to wane from the candles, they were not, as it were,\n",
       "extinguished, but their flame seemed very gradually withdrawn: it was\n",

       "deserted me, or I must have burst through the spell. I did burst through\n",
       "it. I found voice, though the voice was a shriek. I remember that I\n",
       "broke forth with words like these--\"I do not fear, my soul does not\n",
       "fear\"; and at the same time I found the strength to rise. Still in that\n",
       "profound gloom I rushed to one of the windows--tore aside the\n",
       "curtain--flung open the shutters; my first thought was--LIGHT.--And when\n",
       "I saw the moon high, clear, and calm, I felt a joy that almost\n",
       "compensated for the previous terror. There was the moon, there was also\n",
       "the light from the gas-lamps in the deserted slumberous street. I turned\n",
       "to look back into the room; the moon penetrated its shadow very palely\n",
       "and partially--but still there was light. The dark Thing, whatever it\n",
       "might be, was gone--except that I could yet see a dim shadow, which\n",
       "seemed the shadow of that shade, against the opposite wall.\n",
       "\n",
       "My eye now rested on the table, and from under the table (which was\n",
       "without cloth or cover--an old mahogany round table) there rose a hand,\n",
       "visible as far as the wrist. It was a hand, seemingly, as much of flesh\n",
       "and blood as my own, but the hand of an aged person--lean, wrinkled,\n",
       "small, too--a woman's hand. That hand very softly closed on the two\n",
       "letters that lay on the table: hand and letters both vanished.\n",
       "\n",
       "There then came the same three loud measured knocks I heard at the\n",
       "bed-head before this extraordinary drama had commenced.\n",
       "\n",
       "As those sounds slowly ceased, I felt the whole room vibrate sensibly;\n",
       "and at the far end there rose, as from the floor, sparks or globules\n",
       "like bubbles of light, many-colored--green, yellow, fire-red, azure. Up\n",
       "and down, to and fro, hither, thither, as tiny Will-o'-the-Wisps the\n",
       "sparks moved, slow or swift, each at his own caprice. A chair (as in the\n",
       "drawing-room below) was now advanced from the wall without apparent\n",
       "agency, and placed at the opposite side of the table. Suddenly as forth\n",
       "from the chair, there grew a shape--a woman's shape. It was distinct as\n",
       "a shape of life--ghastly as a shape of death. The face was that of\n",
       "youth, with a strange mournful beauty: the throat and shoulders were\n",
       "bare, the rest of the form in a loose robe of cloudy white. It began\n",
       "sleeking its long yellow hair, which fell over its shoulders; its eyes\n",
       "were not turned towards me, but to the door; it seemed listening,\n",
       "watching, waiting. The shadow of the shade in the background grew\n",
       "darker; and again I thought I beheld the eyes gleaming out from the\n",
       "summit of the shadow--eyes fixed upon that shape.\n",
       "\n",
       "As if from the door, though it did not open, there grew out another\n",
       "shape, equally distinct, equally ghastly--a man's shape--a young man's.\n",
       "It was in the dress of the last century, or rather in a likeness of such\n",
       "dress (for both the male shape and the female, though defined, were\n",
       "evidently unsubstantial, impalpable--simulacra--phantasms); and there\n",
       "was something incongruous, grotesque, yet fearful, in the contrast\n",
       "between the elaborate finery, the courtly precision of that\n",
       "old-fashioned garb, with its ruffles and lace and buckles, and the\n",
       "corpse-like aspect and ghost-like stillness of the flitting wearer. Just\n",
       "as the male shape approached the female, the dark shadow started from\n",
       "the wall, all three for a moment wrapped in darkness. When the pale\n",
       "light returned, the two phantoms were as in the grasp of the shadow that\n",
       "towered between them; and there was a blood-stain on the breast of the\n",
       "female; and the phantom male was leaning on its phantom sword, and blood\n",
       "seemed trickling fast from the ruffles, from the lace; and the darkness\n",
       "of the intermediate Shadow swallowed them up--they were gone. And again\n",
       "the bubbles of light shot, and sailed, and undulated, growing thicker\n",
       "and thicker and more wildly confused in their movements.\n",
       "\n",
       "The closet door to the right of the fireplace now opened, and from the\n",

       "some mouldering furniture--three chairs, an oak settle, a table--all of\n",
       "the fashion of about eighty years ago. There was a chest of drawers\n",
       "against the wall, in which we found, half-rotted away, old-fashioned\n",
       "articles of a man's dress, such as might have been worn eighty or a\n",
       "hundred years ago by a gentleman of some rank--costly steel buckles and\n",
       "buttons, like those yet worn in court-dresses, a handsome court\n",
       "sword--in a waistcoat which had once been rich with gold-lace, but which\n",
       "was now blackened and foul with damp, we found five guineas, a few\n",
       "silver coins, and an ivory ticket, probably for some place of\n",
       "entertainment long since passed away. But our main discovery was in a\n",
       "kind of iron safe fixed to the wall, the lock of which it cost us much\n",
       "trouble to get picked.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this safe were three shelves, and two small drawers. Ranged on the\n",
       "shelves were several small bottles of crystal, hermetically stopped.\n",
       "They contained colorless volatile essences, of the nature of which I\n",
       "shall only say that they were not poisons--phosphor and ammonia entered\n",
       "into some of them. There were also some very curious glass tubes, and a\n",
       "small pointed rod of iron, with a large lump of rock-crystal, and\n",
       "another of amber--also a loadstone of great power.\n",
       "\n",
       "In one of the drawers we found a miniature portrait set in gold, and\n",
       "retaining the freshness of its colors most remarkably, considering the\n",
       "length of time it had probably been there. The portrait was that of a\n",
       "man who might be somewhat advanced in middle life, perhaps forty-seven\n",
       "or forty-eight.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was a remarkable face--a most impressive face. If you could fancy\n",
       "some mighty serpent transformed into a man, preserving in the human\n",
       "lineaments the old serpent type, you would have a better idea of that\n",
       "countenance than long descriptions can convey: the width and flatness of\n",
       "frontal--the tapering elegance of contour disguising the strength of the\n",
       "deadly jaw--the long, large, terrible eye, glittering and green as the\n",
       "emerald--and withal a certain ruthless calm, as if from the\n",
       "consciousness of an immense power.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mechanically I turned round the miniature to examine the back of it,\n",
       "and on the back was engraved a pentacle; in the middle of the pentacle a\n",
       "ladder, and the third step of the ladder was formed by the date 1765.\n",
       "Examining still more minutely, I detected a spring; this, on being\n",
       "pressed, opened the back of the miniature as a lid. Withinside the lid\n",
       "were engraved, \"Marianna to thee--be faithful in life and in death\n",
       "to----.\" Here follows a name that I will not mention, but it was not\n",
       "unfamiliar to me. I had heard it spoken of by old men in my childhood as\n",
       "the name borne by a dazzling charlatan who had made a great sensation in\n",
       "London for a year or so, and had fled the country on the charge of a\n",
       "double murder within his own house--that of his mistress and his rival.\n",
       "I said nothing of this to Mr. J----, to whom reluctantly I resigned the\n",
       "miniature.\n",
       "\n",
       "We had found no difficulty in opening the first drawer within the iron\n",
       "safe; we found great difficulty in opening the second: it was not\n",
       "locked, but it resisted all efforts, till we inserted in the clinks the\n",
       "edge of a chisel. When we had thus drawn it forth we found a very\n",
       "singular apparatus in the nicest order. Upon a small thin book, or\n",
       "rather tablet, was placed a saucer of crystal: this saucer was filled\n",
       "with a clear liquid--on that liquid floated a kind of compass, with a\n",
       "needle shifting rapidly round; but instead of the usual points of a\n",
       "compass were seven strange characters, not very unlike those used by\n",
       "astrologers to denote the planets.\n",
       "\n",
       "A peculiar, but not strong nor displeasing odor came from this drawer,\n",
       "which was lined with a wood that we afterwards discovered to be hazel.\n",
       "Whatever the cause of this odor, it produced a material effect on the\n",
       "nerves. We all felt it, even the two workmen who were in the room--a\n",
       "creeping tingling sensation from the tips of the fingers to the roots of\n",
       "the hair. Impatient to examine the tablet, I removed the saucer. As I\n",
       "did so the needle of the compass went round and round with exceeding\n",
       "swiftness, and I felt a shock that ran through my whole frame, so that\n",
       "I dropped the saucer on the floor. The liquid was spilt--the saucer was\n",
       "broken--the compass rolled to the end of the room--and at that instant\n",
       "the walls shook to and fro, as if a giant had swayed and rocked them.\n",
       "\n",
       "The two workmen were so frightened that they ran up the ladder by which\n",
       "we had descended from the trap-door; but seeing that nothing more\n",
       "happened, they were easily induced to return.\n",
       "\n",
       "Meanwhile I had opened the tablet: it was bound in plain red leather,\n",
       "with a silver clasp; it contained but one sheet of thick vellum, and on\n",
       "that sheet were inscribed within a double pentacle, words in old monkish\n",
       "Latin, which are literally to be translated thus: \"On all that it can\n",
       "reach within these walls--sentient or inanimate, living or dead--as\n",
       "moves the needle, so work my will! Accursed be the house, and restless\n",
       "be the dwellers therein.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "We found no more. Mr. J---- burnt the tablet and its anathema. He razed\n",
       "to the foundations the part of the building containing the secret room\n",
       "with the chamber over it. He had then the courage to inhabit the house\n",
       "himself for a month, and a quieter, better-conditioned house could not\n",
       "be found in all London. Subsequently he let it to advantage, and his\n",
       "tenant has made no complaints.\n",

       "The uproarious merriment of a wedding-feast burst forth into the night\n",
       "from a brilliantly lighted house in the \"gasse\" (narrow street). It was\n",
       "one of those nights touched with the warmth of spring, but dark and full\n",
       "of soft mist. Most fitting it was for a celebration of the union of two\n",
       "yearning hearts to share the same lot, a lot that may possibly dawn in\n",
       "sunny brightness, but also become clouded and sullen--for a long, long\n",
       "time! But how merry and joyous they were over there, those people of the\n",
       "happy olden times! They, like us, had their troubles and trials, and\n",
       "when misfortune visited them it came not to them with soft cushions and\n",
       "tender pressures of the hand. Rough and hard, with clinched fist, it\n",
       "laid hold upon them. But when they gave vent to their happy feelings and\n",
       "sought to enjoy themselves, they were like swimmers in cooling waters.\n",
       "They struck out into the stream with freshness and courage, suffered\n",
       "themselves to be borne along by the current whithersoever it took its\n",
       "course. This was the cause of such a jubilee, such a thoughtlessly noisy\n",
       "outburst of all kinds of soul-possessing gayety from this house of\n",
       "nuptials.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And if I had known,\" the bride's father, the rich Ruben Klattaner, had\n",
       "just said, \"that it would take the last gulden in my pocket, then out it\n",
       "would have come.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "In fact, it did appear as if the last groschen had really taken flight,\n",
       "and was fluttering about in the form of platters heaped up with geese\n",
       "and pastry-tarts. Since two o'clock--that is, since the marriage\n",
       "ceremony had been performed out in the open street--until nearly\n",
       "midnight, the wedding-feast had been progressing, and even yet the\n",
       "_sarvers_, or waiters, were hurrying from room to room. It was as if a\n",
       "twofold blessing had descended upon all this abundance of food and\n",
       "drink, for, in the first place, they did not seem to diminish; secondly,\n",
       "they ever found a new place for disposal. To be sure, this appetite was\n",
       "sharpened by the presence of a little dwarf-like, unimportant-looking\n",
       "man. He was esteemed, however, none the less highly by every one. They\n",
       "had specially written to engage the celebrated \"Leb Narr,\" of Prague.\n",
       "And when was ever a mood so out of sorts, a heart so imbittered as not\n",
       "to thaw out and laugh if Leb Narr played one of his pranks. Ah, thou art\n",
       "now dead, good fool! Thy lips, once always ready with a witty reply, are\n",
       "closed. Thy mouth, then never still, now speaks no more! But when the\n",
       "hearty peals of laughter once rang forth at thy command, intercessors,\n",
       "as it were, in thy behalf before the very throne of God, thou hadst\n",
       "nothing to fear. And the joy of that \"other\" world was thine, that joy\n",
       "that has ever belonged to the most pious of country rabbis!\n",
       "\n",
       "In the mean time the young people had assembled in one of the rooms to\n",
       "dance. It was strange how the sound of violins and trumpets accorded\n",
       "with the drolleries of the wit from Prague. In one part the outbursts of\n",
       "merriment were so boisterous that the very candles on the little table\n",
       "seemed to flicker with terror; in another an ordinary conversation was\n",
       "in progress, which now and then only ran over into a loud tittering,\n",
       "when some old lady slipped into the circle and tried her skill at a\n",
       "redowa, then altogether unknown to the young people. In the very midst\n",
       "of the tangle of dancers was to be seen the bride in a heavy silk\n",
       "wedding-gown. The point of her golden hood hung far down over her face.\n",
       "She danced continuously. She danced with every one that asked her. Had\n",
       "one, however, observed the actions of the young woman, they would\n",
       "certainly have seemed to him hurried, agitated, almost wild. She looked\n",
       "no one in the eye, not even her own bridegroom. He stood for the most\n",
       "part in the door-way, and evidently took more pleasure in the witticisms\n",
       "of the fool than in the dance or the lady dancers. But who ever thought\n",
       "for a moment why the young woman's hand burned, why her breath was so\n",
       "hot when one came near to her lips? Who should have noticed so strange\n",
       "a thing? A low whispering already passed through the company, a stealthy\n",
       "smile stole across many a lip. A bevy of ladies was seen to enter the\n",
       "room suddenly. The music dashed off into one of its loudest pieces, and,\n",
       "as if by enchantment, the newly made bride disappeared behind the\n",
       "ladies. The bridegroom, with his stupid, smiling mien, was still left\n",
       "standing on the threshold. But it was not long before he too vanished.\n",
       "One could hardly say how it happened. But people understand such\n",
       "skillful movements by experience, and will continue to understand them\n",
       "as long as there are brides and grooms in the world.\n",
       "\n",
       "This disappearance of the chief personages, little as it seemed to be\n",
       "noticed, gave, however, the signal for general leave-taking. The dancing\n",
       "became drowsy; it stopped all at once, as if by appointment. That noisy\n",
       "confusion now began which always attends so merry a wedding-party.\n",
       "Half-drunken voices could be heard still intermingled with a last,\n",
       "hearty laugh over a joke of the fool from Prague echoing across the\n",
       "table. Here and there some one, not quite sure of his balance, was\n",
       "fumbling for the arm of his chair or the edge of the table. This\n",
       "resulted in his overturning a dish that had been forgotten, or in\n",
       "spilling a beer-glass. While this, in turn, set up a new hubbub, some\n",
       "one else, in his eagerness to betake himself from the scene, fell flat\n",
       "into the very débris. But all this tumult was really hushed the moment\n",
       "they all pressed to the door, for at that very instant shrieks, cries of\n",
       "pain, were heard issuing from the entrance below. In an instant the\n",
       "entire outpouring crowd with all possible force pushed back into the\n",
       "room, but it was a long time before the stream was pressed back again.\n",
       "Meanwhile, painful cries were again heard from below, so painful,\n",
       "indeed, that they restored even the most drunken to a state of\n",
       "consciousness.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"By the living God!\" they cried to each other, \"what is the matter down\n",
       "there? Is the house on fire?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She is gone! she is gone!\" shrieked a woman's voice from the entry\n",
       "below.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Who? who?\" groaned the wedding-guests, seized, as it were, with an icy\n",
       "horror.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Gone! gone!\" cried the woman from the entry, and hurrying up the stairs\n",
       "came Selde Klattaner, the mother of the bride, pale as death, her eyes\n",
       "dilated with most awful fright, convulsively grasping a candle in her\n",
       "hand. \"For God's sake, what has happened?\" was heard on every side of\n",
       "her.\n",
       "\n",
       "The sight of so many people about her, and the confusion of voices,\n",
       "seemed to release the poor woman from a kind of stupor. She glanced\n",
       "shyly about her then, as if overcome with a sense of shame stronger than\n",
       "her terror, and said, in a suppressed tone:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nothing, nothing, good people. In God's name, I ask, what was there to\n",
       "happen?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Dissimulation, however, was too evident to suffice to deceive them.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why, then, did you shriek so, Selde,\" called out one of the guests to\n",
       "her, \"if nothing happened?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, she has gone,\" Selde now moaned in heart-rending tones, \"and she\n",
       "has certainly done herself some harm!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The cause of this strange scene was now first discovered. The bride has\n",
       "disappeared from the wedding-feast. Soon after that she had vanished in\n",
       "such a mysterious way, the bridegroom went below to the dimly-lighted\n",
       "room to find her, but in vain. At first thought this seemed to him to be\n",
       "a sort of bashful jest; but not finding her here, a mysterious\n",
       "foreboding seized him. He called to the mother of the bride:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Woe to me! This woman has gone!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Presently this party, that had so admirably controlled itself, was again\n",
       "thrown into commotion. \"There was nothing to do,\" was said on all sides,\n",
       "\"but to ransack every nook and corner. Remarkable instances of such\n",
       "disappearances of brides had been known. Evil spirits were wont to lurk\n",
       "about such nights and to inflict mankind with all sorts of sorceries.\"\n",
       "Strange as this explanation may seem, there were many who believed it at\n",
       "this very moment, and, most of all, Selde Klattaner herself. But it was\n",
       "only for a moment, for she at once exclaimed:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, no, my good people, she is gone; I know she is gone!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Now for the first time many of them, especially the mothers, felt\n",
       "particularly uneasy, and anxiously called their daughters to them. Only\n",
       "a few showed courage, and urged that they must search and search, even\n",
       "if they had to turn aside the river Iser a hundred times. They urgently\n",
       "pressed on, called for torches and lanterns, and started forth. The\n",
       "cowardly ran after them up and down the stairs. Before any one perceived\n",
       "it the room was entirely forsaken.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ruben Klattaner stood in the hall entry below, and let the people hurry\n",
       "past him without exchanging a word with any. Bitter disappointment and\n",
       "fear had almost crazed him. One of the last to stay in the room above\n",
       "with Selde was, strange to say, Leb Narr, of Prague. After all had\n",
       "departed, he approached the miserable mother, and, in a tone least\n",
       "becoming his general manner, inquired:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Tell me, now, Mrs. Selde, did she not wish to have 'him'?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Whom? whom?\" cried Selde, with renewed alarm, when she found herself\n",
       "alone with the fool.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I mean,\" said Leb, in a most sympathetic manner, approaching still\n",
       "nearer to Selde, \"that maybe you had to make your daughter marry him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Make? And have we, then, made her?\" moaned Selde, staring at the fool\n",
       "with a look of uncertainty.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then nobody needs to search for her,\" replied the fool, with a\n",
       "sympathetic laugh, at the same time retreating. \"It's better to leave\n",
       "her where she is.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Without saying thanks or good-night, he was gone.\n",
       "\n",
       "Meanwhile the cause of all this disturbance had arrived at the end of\n",
       "her flight.\n",
       "\n",
       "Close by the synagogue was situated the house of the rabbi. It was built\n",
       "in an angle of a very narrow street, set in a framework of tall\n",
       "shade-trees. Even by daylight it was dismal enough. At night it was\n",
       "almost impossible for a timid person to approach it, for people declared\n",
       "that the low supplications of the dead could be heard in the dingy house\n",
       "of God when at night they took the rolls of the law from the ark to\n",
       "summon their members by name.\n",
       "\n",
       "Through this retired street passed, or rather ran, at this hour a shy\n",
       "form. Arriving at the dwelling of the rabbi, she glanced backward to see\n",
       "whether any one was following her. But all was silent and gloomy enough\n",
       "about her. A pale light issued from one of the windows of the synagogue;\n",
       "it came from the \"eternal lamp\" hanging in front of the ark of the\n",
       "covenant. But at this moment it seemed to her as if a supernatural eye\n",
       "was gazing upon her. Thoroughly affrighted, she seized the little iron\n",
       "knocker of the door and struck it gently. But the throb of her beating\n",
       "heart was even louder, more violent, than this blow. After a pause,\n",
       "footsteps were heard passing slowly along the hallway.\n",
       "\n",
       "The rabbi had not occupied this lonely house a long time. His\n",
       "predecessor, almost a centenarian in years, had been laid to rest a few\n",
       "months before. The new rabbi had been called, from a distant part of the\n",
       "country. He was unmarried, and in the prime of life. No one had known\n",
       "him before his coming. But his personal nobility and the profundity of\n",
       "his scholarship made up for his deficiency in years. An aged mother had\n",
       "accompanied him from their distant home, and she took the place of wife\n",
       "and child.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Who is there?\" asked the rabbi, who had been busy at his desk even at\n",
       "this late hour and thus had not missed hearing the knocker.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is I,\" the figure without responded, almost inaudibly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Speak louder, if you wish me to hear you,\" replied the rabbi.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is I, Ruben Klattaner's daughter,\" she repeated.\n",
       "\n",
       "The name seemed to sound strange to the rabbi. He as yet knew too few of\n",
       "his congregation to understand that this very day he performed the\n",
       "marriage ceremony of the person who had just repeated her name.\n",
       "Therefore he called out, after a moment's pause, \"What do you wish so\n",
       "late at night?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Open the door, rabbi,\" she answered, pleadingly, \"or I shall die at\n",
       "once!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The bolt was pushed back. Something gleaming, rustling, glided past the\n",
       "rabbi into the dusky hall. The light of the candle in his hand was not\n",
       "sufficient to allow him to descry it. Before he had time to address her,\n",
       "she had vanished past him and had disappeared through the open door\n",
       "into the room. Shaking his head, the rabbi again bolted the door.\n",
       "\n",
       "On reëntering the room he saw a woman's form sitting in the chair which\n",
       "he usually occupied. She had her back turned to him. Her head was bent\n",
       "low over her breast. Her golden wedding-hood, with its shading lace, was\n",
       "pulled down over her forehead. Courageous and pious as the rabbi was, he\n",
       "could not rid himself of a feeling of terror.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Who are you?\" he demanded, in a loud tone, as if its sound alone would\n",
       "banish the presence of this being that seemed to him at this moment to\n",
       "be the production of all the enchantments of evil spirits.\n",
       "\n",
       "She raised herself, and cried in a voice that seemed to come from the\n",
       "agony of a human being:\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "On hearing this familiar voice the rabbi stood speechless. He gazed at\n",
       "the young woman. Now, indeed, he must regard her as one bereft of\n",
       "reason, rather than as a specter.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, if you are she,\" he stammered out, after a pause, for it was with\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I know no other place to which I belong more than here where I now am!\"\n",
       "she answered, severely.\n",
       "\n",
       "These words puzzled the rabbi still more. Is it really an insane woman\n",
       "before him? He must have thought so, for he now addressed her in a\n",
       "gentle tone of voice, as we do those suffering from this kind of\n",
       "sickness, in order not to excite her, and said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The place where you belong, my daughter, is in the house of your\n",
       "parents, and, since you have to-day been made a wife, your place is in\n",
       "your husband's house.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The young woman muttered something which failed to reach the rabbi's\n",
       "ear. Yet he only continued to think that he saw before him some poor\n",
       "unfortunate whose mind was deranged. After a pause, he added, in a still\n",
       "gentler tone: \"What is your name, then, my child?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"God, god,\" she moaned, in the greatest anguish, \"he does not even yet\n",
       "know my name!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How should I know you,\" he continued, apologetically, \"for I am a\n",
       "stranger in this place?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This tender remark seemed to have produced the desired effect upon her\n",
       "excited mind.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My name is Veile,\" she said, quietly, after a pause.\n",
       "\n",
       "The rabbi quickly perceived that he had adopted the right tone towards\n",
       "his mysterious guest.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Veile,\" he said, approaching nearer her, \"what do you wish of me?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Rabbi, I have a great sin resting heavily upon my heart,\" she replied\n",
       "despondently. \"I do not know what to do.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What can you have done,\" inquired the rabbi, with a tender look, \"that\n",
       "cannot be discussed at any other time than just now? Will you let me\n",
       "advise you, Veile?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, no,\" she cried again, violently, \"I will not be advised. I see, I\n",
       "know what oppresses me. Yes, I can grasp it by the hand, it lies so near\n",
       "before me. Is that what you call to be advised?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very well,\" returned the rabbi, seeing that this was the very way to\n",
       "get the young woman to talk--\"very well, I say, you are not imagining\n",
       "anything. I believe that you have greatly sinned. Have you come here\n",
       "then to confess this sin? Do your parents or your husband know anything\n",
       "about it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Who is my husband?\" she interrupted him, impetuously.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thoughts welled up in the rabbi's heart like a tumultuous sea in which\n",
       "opposing conjectures cross and recross each other's course. Should he\n",
       "speak with her as with an ordinary sinner?\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Were you, perhaps, forced to be married?\" he inquired, as quietly as\n",
       "possible, after a pause.\n",
       "\n",
       "A suppressed sob, a strong inward struggle, manifesting itself in the\n",
       "whole trembling body, was the only answer to this question.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Tell me, my child,\" said the rabbi, encouragingly.\n",
       "\n",
       "In such tones as the rabbi had never before heard, so strange, so\n",
       "surpassing any human sounds, the young woman began:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, rabbi, I will speak, even though I know that I shall never go from\n",
       "this place alive, which would be the very best thing for me! No, rabbi,\n",
       "I was not forced to be married. My parents have never once said to me\n",
       "'you must,' but my own will, my own desire, rather, has always been\n",
       "supreme. My husband is the son of a rich man in the community. To enter\n",
       "his family was to be made the first lady in the _gasse_, to sit buried\n",
       "in gold and silver. And that very thing, nothing else, was what\n",
       "infatuated me with him. It was for that that I forced myself, my heart\n",
       "and will, to be married to him, hard as it was for me. But in my\n",
       "innermost heart I detested him. The more he loved me, the more I hated\n",
       "him. But the gold and silver had an influence over me. More and more\n",
       "they cried to me, 'You will be the first lady in the _gasse_!'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Continue,\" said the rabbi, when she ceased, almost exhausted by these\n",
       "words.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What more shall I tell you, rabbi?\" she began again. \"I was never a\n",
       "liar, when a child, or older, and yet during my whole engagement it has\n",
       "seemed to me as if a big, gigantic lie had followed me step by step.\n",
       "I have seen it on every side of me. But to-day, when I stood under the\n",
       "_chuppe_, rabbi, and he took the ring from his finger and put it on\n",
       "mine, and when I had to dance at my own wedding with him, whom I now\n",
       "recognized, now for the first time, as the lie, and--when they led me\n",
       "away----\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This sincere confession escaping from the lips of the young woman, she\n",
       "sobbed aloud and bowed her head still deeper over her breast. The rabbi\n",
       "gazed upon her in silence. No insane woman ever spoke like that! Only a\n",
       "soul conscious of its own sin, but captivated by a mysterious power,\n",
       "could suffer like this!\n",
       "\n",
       "It was not sympathy which he felt with her; it was much more a living\n",
       "over the sufferings of the woman. In spite of the confused story, it was\n",
       "all clear to the rabbi. The cause of the flight from the father's house\n",
       "at this hour also required no explanation. \"I know what you mean,\" he\n",
       "longed to say, but he could only find words to say: \"Speak further,\n",
       "Veile!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The young woman turned towards him. He had not yet seen her face. The\n",
       "golden hood with the shading lace hung deeply over it.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Have I not told you everything?\" she said, with a flush of scorn.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Everything?\" repeated the rabbi, inquiringly. He only said this,\n",
       "moreover, through embarrassment.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do you tell me now,\" she cried, at once passionately and mildly, \"what\n",
       "am I to do?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Veile!\" exclaimed the rabbi, entertaining now, for the first time, a\n",
       "feeling of repugnance for this confidential interview.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Tell me now!\" she pleaded; and before the rabbi could prevent it the\n",
       "young woman threw herself down at his feet and clasped his knees in her\n",
       "arms. This hasty act had loosened the golden wedding-hood from her head,\n",
       "and thus exposed her face to view, a face of remarkable beauty.\n",
       "\n",
       "So overcome was the young rabbi by the sight of it that he had to shade\n",
       "his eyes with his hands, as if before a sudden flash of lightning.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Tell me now, what shall I do?\" she cried again. \"Do you think that I\n",
       "have come from my parents' home merely to return again without help? You\n",
       "alone in the world must tell me. Look at me! I have kept all my hair\n",
       "just as God gave it me. It has never been touched by the shears. Should\n",
       "I, then, do anything to please my husband? I am no wife. I will not be a\n",
       "wife! Tell me, tell me, what am I to do?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Arise, arise,\" bade the rabbi; but his voice quivered, sounded almost\n",
       "painful.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Tell me first,\" she gasped; \"I will not rise till then!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How can I tell you?\" he moaned, almost inaudibly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Naphtali!\" shrieked the kneeling woman.\n",
       "\n",
       "But the rabbi staggered backward. The room seemed ablaze before him,\n",
       "like a bright fire. A sharp cry rang from his breast, as if one\n",
       "suffering from some painful wound had been seized by a rough hand. In\n",
       "his hurried attempt to free himself from the embrace of the young\n",
       "woman, who still clung to his knees, it chanced that her head struck\n",
       "heavily against the floor.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Naphtali!\" she cried once again.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Silence, silence,\" groaned the rabbi, pressing both hands against his\n",
       "head.\n",
       "\n",
       "And still again she called out this name, but not with that agonizing\n",
       "cry. It sounded rather like a commingling of exultation and lamentation.\n",
       "\n",
       "And again he demanded, \"Silence! silence!\" but this time so imperiously,\n",
       "so forcibly, that the young woman lay on the floor as if conjured, not\n",
       "daring to utter a single word.\n",
       "\n",
       "The rabbi paced almost wildly up and down the room. There must have been\n",
       "a hard, terrible struggle in his breast. It seemed to the one lying on\n",
       "the floor that she heard him sigh from the depths of his soul. Then his\n",
       "pacing became calmer; but it did not last long. The fierce conflict\n",
       "again assailed him. His step grew hurried; it echoed loudly through the\n",
       "awful stillness of the room. Suddenly he neared the young woman, who\n",
       "seemed to lie there scarcely breathing. He stopped in front of her. Had\n",
       "any one seen the face of the rabbi at this moment the expression on it\n",
       "would have filled him with terror. There was a marvelous tranquillity\n",
       "overlying it, the tranquillity of a struggle for life or death.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Listen to me now, Veile,\" he began, slowly. \"I will talk with you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I listen, rabbi,\" she whispered.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But do you hear me well?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Only speak,\" she returned.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But will you do what I advise you? Will you not oppose it? For I am\n",
       "going to say something that will terrify you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I will do anything that you say. Only tell me,\" she moaned.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Will you swear?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I will,\" she groaned.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, do not swear yet, until you have heard me,\" he cried. \"I will not\n",
       "force you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This time came no answer.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Hear me, then, daughter of Ruben Klattaner,\" he began, after a pause.\n",
       "\"You have a twofold sin upon your soul, and each is so great, so\n",
       "criminal, that it can only be forgiven by severe punishment. First you\n",
       "permitted yourself to be infatuated by the gold and silver, and then you\n",
       "forced your heart to lie. With the lie you sought to deceive the man,\n",
       "even though he had intrusted you with his all when he made you his wife.\n",
       "A lie is truly a great sin! Streams of water cannot drown them. They\n",
       "make men false and hateful to themselves. The worst that has been\n",
       "committed in the world was led in by a lie. That is the one sin.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I know, I know,\" sobbed the young woman.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Now hear me further,\" began the rabbi again, with a wavering voice,\n",
       "after a short pause. \"You have committed a still greater sin than the\n",
       "first. You have not only deceived your husband, but you have also\n",
       "destroyed the happiness of another person. You could have spoken, and\n",
       "you did not. For life you have robbed him of his happiness, his light,\n",
       "his joy, but you did not speak. What can he now do, when he knows what\n",
       "has been lost to him?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Naphtali!\" cried the young woman.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Silence! silence! do not let that name pass your lips again,\" he\n",
       "demanded, violently. \"The more you repeat it the greater becomes your\n",
       "sin. Why did you not speak when you could have spoken? God can never\n",
       "easily forgive you that. To be silent, to keep secret in one's breast\n",
       "what would have made another man happier than the mightiest monarch!\n",
       "Thereby you have made him more than unhappy. He will nevermore have the\n",
       "desire to be happy. Veile, God in heaven cannot forgive you for that.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Silence! silence!\" groaned the wretched woman.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, Veile,\" he continued, with a stronger voice, \"let me talk now. You\n",
       "are certainly willing to hear me speak? Listen to me. You must do severe\n",
       "penance for this sin, the twofold sin which rests upon your head. God is\n",
       "long-suffering and merciful. He will perhaps look down upon your misery,\n",
       "and will blot out your guilt from the great book of transgressions. But\n",
       "you must become penitent. Hear, now, what it shall be.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The rabbi paused. He was on the point of saying the severest thing that\n",
       "had ever passed his lips.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You were silent, Veile,\" then he cried, \"when you should have spoken.\n",
       "Be silent now forever to all men and to yourself. From the moment you\n",
       "leave this house, until I grant it, you must be dumb; you dare not let a\n",
       "loud word pass from your mouth. Will you undergo this penance?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I will do all you say,\" moaned the young woman.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Will you have strength to do it?\" he asked, gently.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I shall be as silent as death,\" she replied.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And one thing more I have to say to you,\" he continued. \"You are the\n",
       "wife of your husband. Return home and be a Jewish wife.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I understand you,\" she sobbed in reply.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Go to your home now, and bring peace to your parents and husband. The\n",
       "time will come when you may speak, when your sin will be forgiven you.\n",
       "Till then bear what has been laid upon you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"May I say one thing more?\" she cried, lifting up her head.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Speak,\" he said.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Naphtali!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The rabbi covered his eyes with one hand, with the other motioned her to\n",
       "be silent. But she grasped his hand, drew it to her lips. Hot tears fell\n",
       "upon it.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Go now,\" he sobbed, completely broken down.\n",
       "\n",
       "She let go the hand. The rabbi had seized the candle, but she had\n",
       "already passed him, and glided through the dark hall. The door was left\n",
       "open. The rabbi locked it again.\n",
       "\n",
       "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
       "\n",
       "Veile returned to her home, as she had escaped, unnoticed. The narrow\n",
       "street was deserted, as desolate as death. The searchers were to be\n",
       "found everywhere except there where they ought first to have sought for\n",
       "the missing one. Her mother, Selde, still sat on the same chair on which\n",
       "she had sunk down an hour ago. The fright had left her like one\n",
       "paralyzed, and she was unable to rise. What a wonderful contrast this\n",
       "wedding-room, with the mother sitting alone in it, presented to the\n",
       "hilarity reigning here shortly before! On Veile's entrance her mother\n",
       "did not cry out. She had no strength to do so. She merely said: \"So you\n",
       "have come at last, my daughter?\" as if Veile had only returned from a\n",
       "walk somewhat too long. But the young woman did not answer to this and\n",
       "similar questions. Finally she signified by gesticulations that she\n",
       "could not speak. Fright seized the wretched mother a second time, and\n",
       "the entire house was filled with her lamentations.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ruben Klattaner and Veile's husband having now returned from their\n",
       "fruitless search, were horrified on perceiving the change which Veile\n",
       "had undergone. Being men, they did not weep. With staring eyes they\n",
       "gazed upon the silent young woman, and beheld in her an apparition which\n",
       "had been dealt with by God's visitation in a mysterious manner.\n",
       "\n",
       "From this hour began the terrible penance of the young woman.\n",
       "\n",
       "The impression which Veile's woeful condition made upon the people of\n",
       "the _gasse_ was wonderful. Those who had danced with her that evening on\n",
       "the wedding now first recalled her excited state. Her wild actions were\n",
       "now first remembered by many. It must have been an \"evil eye,\" they\n",
       "concluded--a jealous, evil eye, to which her beauty was hateful. This\n",
       "alone could have possessed her with a demon of unrest. She was driven by\n",
       "this evil power into the dark night, a sport of these malicious\n",
       "potencies which pursue men step by step, especially on such occasions.\n",
       "The living God alone knows what she must have seen that night. Nothing\n",
       "good, else one would not become dumb. Old legends and tales were\n",
       "revived, each more horrible than the other. Hundreds of instances were\n",
       "given to prove that this was nothing new in the _gasse_. Despite this\n",
       "explanation, it is remarkable that the people did not believe that the\n",
       "young woman was dumb. The most thought that her power of speech had been\n",
       "paralyzed by some awful fright, but that with time it would be restored.\n",
       "Under this supposition they called her \"Veile the Silent.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "There is a kind of human eloquence more telling, more forcible than the\n",
       "loudest words, than the choicest diction--the silence of woman!\n",
       "Ofttimes they cannot endure the slightest vexation, but some great,\n",
       "heart-breaking sorrow, some pain from constant renunciation,\n",
       "self-sacrifice, they suffer with sealed lips--as if, in very truth, they\n",
       "were bound with bars of iron.\n",
       "\n",
       "It would be difficult to fully describe that long \"silent\" life of the\n",
       "young woman. It is almost impossible to cite more than one incident.\n",
       "Veile accompanied her husband to his home, that house resplendent with\n",
       "that gold and silver which had infatuated her. She was, to be sure, the\n",
       "\"first\" woman in the _gasse_; she had everything in abundance. Indeed,\n",
       "the world supposed that she had but little cause for complaint. \"Must\n",
       "one have everything?\" was sometimes queried in the _gasse_. \"One has one\n",
       "thing; another, another.\" And, according to all appearances, the people\n",
       "were right. Veile continued to be the beautiful, blooming woman. Her\n",
       "penance of silence did not deprive her of a single charm. She was so\n",
       "very happy, indeed, that she did not seem to feel even the pain of her\n",
       "punishment. Veile could laugh and rejoice, but never did she forget to\n",
       "be silent. The seemingly happy days, however, were only qualified to\n",
       "bring about the proper time of trials and temptations. The beginning was\n",
       "easy enough for her, the middle and end were times of real pain. The\n",
       "first years of their wedded life were childless. \"It is well,\" the\n",
       "people in the _gasse_ said, \"that she has no children, and God has\n",
       "rightly ordained it to be so. A mother who cannot talk to her child,\n",
       "that would be something awful!\" Unexpectedly to all, she rejoiced one\n",
       "day in the birth of a daughter. And when that affectionate young\n",
       "creature, her own offspring, was laid upon her breast, and the first\n",
       "sounds were uttered by its lips--that nameless, eloquent utterance of an\n",
       "infant--she forgot herself not; she was silent!\n",
       "\n",
       "She was silent also when from day to day that child blossomed before her\n",
       "eyes into fuller beauty. Nor had she any words for it when, in effusions\n",
       "of tenderness, it stretched forth its tiny arms, when in burning fever\n",
       "it sought for the mother's hand. For days--yes, weeks--together she\n",
       "watched at its bedside. Sleep never visited her eyes. But she ever\n",
       "remembered her penance.\n",

       "Years fled by. In her arms she carried another child. It was a boy. The\n",
       "father's joy was great. The child inherited its mother's beauty. Like\n",
       "its sister, it grew in health and strength. The noblest, richest mother,\n",
       "they said, might be proud of such children! And Veile was proud, no\n",
       "doubt, but this never passed her lips. She remained silent about things\n",
       "which mothers in their joy often cannot find words enough to express.\n",
       "And although her face many times lighted up with beaming smiles, yet she\n",
       "never renounced the habitual silence imposed upon her.\n",
       "\n",
       "The idea that the slightest dereliction of her penance would be\n",

       "this mother suffered from her penalty of silence.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus a part of those years sped away which we are wont to call the best.\n",
       "She still flourished in her wonderful beauty. Her maiden daughter was\n",
       "beside her, like the bud beside the full-blown rose. Suitors were\n",
       "already present from far and near, who passed in review before the\n",
       "beautiful girl. The most of them were excellent young men, and any\n",
       "mother might have been proud in having her own daughter sought by such.\n",
       "Even then Veile did not undo her penance. Those busy times of\n",
       "intercourse which keep mothers engaged in presenting the superiorities\n",
       "of their daughters in the best light were not allowed her. The choice of\n",
       "one of the most favored suitors was made. Never before did any couple in\n",
       "the _gasse_ equal this in beauty and grace. A few weeks before the\n",
       "appointed time for the wedding a malignant disease stole on, spreading\n",
       "sorrow and anxiety over the greater part of the land. Young girls were\n",
       "principally its victims. It seemed to pass scornfully over the aged and\n",
       "infirm. Veile's daughter was also laid hold upon by it. Before three\n",
       "days had passed there was a corpse in the house--the bride!\n",
       "\n",
       "Even then Veile did not forget her penance. When they bore away the\n",
       "corpse to the \"good place,\" she did utter a cry of anguish which long\n",
       "after echoed in the ears of the people; she did wring her hands in\n",
       "despair, but no one heard a word of complaint. Her lips seemed dumb\n",
       "forever. It was then, when she was seated on the low stool in the seven\n",
       "days of mourning, that the rabbi came to her, to bring to her the usual\n",
       "consolation for the dead. But he did not speak with her. He addressed\n",
       "words only to her husband. She herself dared not look up. Only when he\n",
       "turned to go did she lift her eyes. They, in turn, met the eyes of the\n",
       "rabbi, but he departed without a farewell.\n",
       "\n",
       "After her daughter's death Veile was completely broken down. Even that\n",
       "which at her time of life is still called beauty had faded away within a\n",
       "few days. Her cheeks had become hollow, her hair gray. Visitors wondered\n",
       "how she could endure such a shock, how body and spirit could hold\n",
       "together. They did not know that that silence was an iron fetter firmly\n",
       "imprisoning the slumbering spirits. She had a son, moreover, to whom, as\n",
       "to something last and dearest, her whole being still clung.\n",
       "\n",
       "The boy was thirteen years old. His learning in the Holy Scriptures was\n",
       "already celebrated for miles around. He was the pupil of the rabbi, who\n",
       "had treated him with a love and tenderness becoming his own father. He\n",
       "said that he was a remarkable child, endowed with rare talents. The boy\n",
       "was to be sent to Hungary, to one of the most celebrated teachers of the\n",
       "times, in order to lay the foundation for his sacred studies under this\n",
       "instructor's guidance and wisdom. Years might perhaps pass before she\n",
       "would see him again. But Veile let her boy go from her embrace. She did\n",
       "not say a blessing over him when he went; only her lips twitched with\n",
       "the pain of silence.\n",
       "\n",
       "Long years expired before the boy returned from the strange land, a\n",
       "full-grown, noble youth. When Veile had her son with her again a smile\n",
       "played about her mouth, and for a moment it seemed as if her former\n",
       "beauty had enjoyed a second spring. The extraordinary ability of her son\n",
       "already made him famous. Wheresoever he went people were delighted with\n",
       "his beauty, and admired the modesty of his manner, despite such great\n",
       "scholarship.\n",
       "\n",
       "The next Sabbath the young disciple of the Talmud, scarcely twenty years\n",
       "of age, was to demonstrate the first marks of this great learning.\n",
       "\n",
       "The people crowded shoulder to shoulder in this great synagogue. Curious\n",
       "glances were cast through the lattice-work of the women's gallery above\n",
       "upon the dense throng. Veile occupied one of the foremost seats. She\n",
       "could see everything that took place below. Her face was extremely pale.\n",
       "All eyes were turned towards her--the mother, who was permitted to see\n",
       "such a day for her son! But Veile did not appear to notice what was\n",
       "happening before her. A weariness, such as she had never felt before,\n",
       "even in her greatest suffering, crept over her limbs. It was as if she\n",
       "must sleep during her son's address. He had hardly mounted the stairs\n",
       "before the ark of the laws--hardly uttered his first words--when a\n",
       "remarkable change crossed her face. Her cheeks burned. She arose. All\n",
       "her vital energy seemed aroused. Her son meanwhile was speaking down\n",
       "below. She could not have told what he was saying. She did not hear\n",
       "him--she only heard the murmur of approbation, sometimes low, sometimes\n",
       "loud, which came to her ears from the quarters of the men. The people\n",
       "were astonished at the noble bearing of the speaker, his melodious\n",
       "speech, and his powerful energy. When he stopped at certain times to\n",
       "rest it seemed as if one were in a wood swept by a storm. She could now\n",
       "and then hear a few voices declaring that such a one had never before\n",
       "been listened to. The women at her side wept; she alone could not. A\n",
       "choking pain pressed from her breast to her lips. Forces were astir in\n",
       "her heart which struggled for expression. The whole synagogue echoed\n",
       "with buzzing voices, but to her it seemed as if she must speak louder\n",
       "than these. At the very moment her son had ended she cried out\n",
       "unconsciously, violently throwing herself against the lattice-work:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"God! living God! shall I not now speak?\" A dead silence followed this\n",
       "outcry. Nearly all had recognized this voice as that of the \"silent\n",
       "woman.\" A miracle had taken place!\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Speak! speak!\" resounded the answer of the rabbi from the men's seats\n",
       "below. \"You may now speak!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But no reply came. Veile had fallen back into her seat, pressing both\n",
       "hands against her breast. When the women sitting beside her looked at\n",
       "her they were terrified to find that the \"silent woman\" had fainted.\n",
       "She was dead! The unsealing of her lips was her last moment.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Of all Irish ghosts, fairies, or bogles, the Banshee (sometimes called\n",
       "locally the \"Boh[=ee]ntha\" or \"Bank[=ee]ntha\") is the best known to the\n",
       "general public: indeed, cross-Channel visitors would class her with\n",
       "pigs, potatoes, and other fauna and flora of Ireland, and would expect\n",
       "her to make manifest her presence to them as being one of the sights of\n",
       "the country. She is a spirit with a lengthy pedigree--how lengthy no man\n",
       "can say, as its roots go back into the dim, mysterious past. The most\n",
       "famous Banshee of ancient times was that attached to the kingly house of\n",
       "O'Brien, Aibhill, who haunted the rock of Craglea above Killaloe, near\n",
       "the old palace of Kincora. In A.D. 1014 was fought the battle of\n",
       "Clontarf, from which the aged king, Brian Boru, knew that he would never\n",
       "come away alive, for the previous night Aibhill had appeared to him to\n",
       "tell him of his impending fate. The Banshee's method of foretelling\n",
       "death in olden times differed from that adopted by her at the present\n",
       "day: now she wails and wrings her hands, as a general rule, but in the\n",
       "old Irish tales she is to be found washing human heads and limbs, or\n",
       "blood-stained clothes, till the water is all dyed with human blood--this\n",
       "would take place before a battle. So it would seem that in the course of\n",
       "centuries her attributes and characteristics have changed somewhat.\n",
       "\n",
       "Very different descriptions are given of her personal appearance.\n",
       "Sometimes she is young and beautiful, sometimes old and of a fearsome\n",
       "appearance. One writer describes her as \"a tall, thin woman with\n",
       "uncovered head, and long hair that floated round her shoulders, attired\n",
       "in something which seemed either a loose white cloak, or a sheet thrown\n",
       "hastily around her, uttering piercing cries.\" Another person, a\n",
       "coachman, saw her one evening sitting on a stile in the yard; she seemed\n",
       "to be a very small woman, with blue eyes, long light hair, and wearing\n",
       "a red cloak. Other descriptions will be found in this chapter. By the\n",
       "way, it does not seem to be true that the Banshee exclusively follows\n",
       "families of Irish descent, for the last incident had reference to the\n",
       "death of a member of a Co. Galway family English by name and origin.\n",
       "\n",
       "One of the oldest and best-known Banshee stories is that related in the\n",
       "_Memoirs_ of Lady Fanshaw.[F] In 1642 her husband, Sir Richard, and she\n",
       "chanced to visit a friend, the head of an Irish sept, who resided in his\n",
       "ancient baronial castle, surrounded with a moat. At midnight she was\n",
       "awakened by a ghastly and supernatural scream, and looking out of bed,\n",
       "beheld in the moonlight a female face and part of the form hovering at\n",
       "the window. The distance from the ground, as well as the circumstance of\n",
       "the moat, excluded the possibility that what she beheld was of this\n",
       "world. The face was that of a young and rather handsome woman, but pale,\n",
       "and the hair, which was reddish, was loose and disheveled. The dress,\n",
       "which Lady Fanshaw's terror did not prevent her remarking accurately,\n",
       "was that of the ancient Irish. This apparition continued to exhibit\n",
       "itself for some time, and then vanished with two shrieks similar to that\n",
       "which had first excited Lady Fanshaw's attention. In the morning, with\n",
       "infinite terror, she communicated to her host what she had witnessed,\n",
       "and found him prepared not only to credit, but to account for the\n",
       "superstition. \"A near relation of my family,\" said he; \"expired last\n",
       "night in this castle. We disguised our certain expectation of the event\n",
       "from you, lest it should throw a cloud over the cheerful reception which\n",
       "was your due. Now, before such an event happens in this family or\n",
       "castle, the female specter whom you have seen is always visible. She is\n",
       "believed to be the spirit of a woman of inferior rank, whom one of my\n",
       "ancestors degraded himself by marrying, and whom afterwards, to expiate\n",
       "the dishonor done to his family, he caused to be drowned in the moat.\"\n",
       "In strictness this woman could hardly be termed a Banshee. The motive\n",
       "for the haunting is akin to that in the tale of the Scotch \"Drummer of\n",
       "Cortachy,\" where the spirit of the murdered man haunts the family out of\n",
       "revenge, and appears before a death.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. T.J. Westropp, M.A., has furnished the following story: \"My maternal\n",
       "grandmother heard the following tradition from her mother, one of the\n",
       "Miss Ross-Lewins, who witnessed the occurrence. Their father, Mr.\n",
       "Harrison Ross-Lewin, was away in Dublin on law business, and in his\n",
       "absence the young people went off to spend the evening with a friend who\n",
       "lived some miles away. The night was fine and lightsome as they were\n",
       "returning, save at one point where the road ran between trees or high\n",
       "hedges not far to the west of the old church of Kilchrist. The latter,\n",
       "like many similar ruins, was a simple oblong building, with long\n",
       "side-walls and high gables, and at that time it and its graveyard were\n",
       "unenclosed, and lay in the open fields. As the party passed down the\n",
       "long dark lane they suddenly heard in the distance loud keening and\n",
       "clapping of hands, as the country-people were accustomed to do when\n",
       "lamenting the dead. The Ross-Lewins hurried on, and came in sight of the\n",
       "church, on the side wall of which a little gray-haired old woman, clad\n",
       "in a dark cloak, was running to and fro, chanting and wailing, and\n",
       "throwing up her arms. The girls were very frightened, but the young men\n",
       "ran forward and surrounded the ruin, and two of them went into the\n",
       "church, the apparition vanishing from the wall as they did so. They\n",
       "searched every nook, and found no one, nor did any one pass out. All\n",
       "were now well scared, and got home as fast as possible. On reaching\n",
       "their home their mother opened the door, and at once told them that she\n",
       "was in terror about their father, for, as she sat looking out the window\n",
       "in the moonlight, a huge raven with fiery eyes lit on the sill, and\n",
       "tapped three times on the glass. They told her their story, which only\n",
       "added to their anxiety, and as they stood talking, taps came to the\n",
       "nearest window, and they saw the bird again. A few days later news\n",
       "reached them that Mr. Ross-Lewin had died suddenly in Dublin. This\n",
       "occurred about 1776.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Westropp also writes that the sister of a former Roman Catholic\n",
       "Bishop told his sisters that when she was a little girl she went out\n",
       "one evening with some other children for a walk. Going down the road,\n",
       "they passed the gate of the principal demesne near the town. There was a\n",
       "rock, or large stone, beside the road, on which they saw something.\n",
       "Going nearer, they perceived it to be a little dark, old woman, who\n",
       "began crying and clapping her hands. Some of them attempted to speak to\n",
       "her, but got frightened, and all finally ran home as quickly as they\n",
       "could. Next day the news came that the gentleman near whose gate the\n",
       "Banshee had cried, was dead, and it was found on inquiry that he had\n",
       "died at the very hour at which the children had seen the specter.\n",
       "\n",
       "A lady who is a relation of one of the compilers, and a member of a Co.\n",
       "Cork family of English descent, sends the two following experiences of a\n",
       "Banshee in her family. \"My mother, when a young girl, was standing\n",
       "looking out of the window in their house at Blackrock, near Cork. She\n",
       "suddenly saw a white figure standing on a bridge which was easily\n",
       "visible from the house. The figure waved her arms towards the house, and\n",
       "my mother heard the bitter wailing of the Banshee. It lasted some\n",
       "seconds, and then the figure disappeared. Next morning my grandfather\n",
       "was walking as usual into the city of Cork. He accidentally fell, hit\n",
       "his head against the curbstone, and never recovered consciousness.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"In March, 1900, my mother was very ill, and one evening the nurse and I\n",
       "were with her arranging her bed. We suddenly heard the most extraordinary\n",
       "wailing, which seemed to come in waves round and under her bed. We\n",
       "naturally looked everywhere to try and find the cause, but in vain. The\n",
       "nurse and I looked at one another, but made no remark, as my mother did\n",
       "not seem to hear it. My sister was downstairs sitting with my father.\n",
       "She heard it, and thought some terrible thing had happened to her little\n",
       "boy, who was in bed upstairs. She rushed up, and found him sleeping\n",
       "quietly. My father did not hear it. In the house next door they heard\n",
       "it, and ran downstairs, thinking something had happened to the servant;\n",
       "but the latter at once said to them, 'Did you hear the Banshee? Mrs.\n",
       "P---- must be dying.'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "A few years ago (_i.e._ before 1894) a curious incident occurred in a\n",
       "public school in connection with the belief in the Banshee. One of the\n",
       "boys, happening to become ill, was at once placed in a room by himself,\n",
       "where he used to sit all day. On one occasion, as he was being visited\n",
       "by the doctor, he suddenly started up from his seat, and affirmed that\n",
       "he heard somebody crying. The doctor, of course, who could hear or see\n",
       "nothing, came to the conclusion that the illness had slightly affected\n",
       "his brain. However, the boy, who appeared quite sensible, still\n",
       "persisted that he heard some one crying, and furthermore said, \"It is\n",
       "the Banshee, as I have heard it before.\" The following morning the\n",
       "head-master received a telegram saying that the boy's brother had been\n",
       "accidentally shot dead.[G]\n",
       "\n",
       "That the Banshee is not confined within the geographical limits of\n",
       "Ireland, but that she can follow the fortunes of a family abroad, and\n",
       "there foretell their death, is clearly shown by the following story. A\n",
       "party of visitors were gathered together on the deck of a private yacht\n",
       "on one of the Italian lakes, and during a lull in the conversation one\n",
       "of them, a Colonel, said to the owner, \"Count, who's that queer-looking\n",
       "woman you have on board?\" The Count replied that there was nobody except\n",
       "the ladies present, and the stewardess, but the speaker protested that\n",
       "he was correct, and suddenly, with a scream of horror, he placed his\n",
       "hands before his eyes, and exclaimed, \"Oh, my God, what a face!\" For\n",
       "some time he was overcome with terror, and at length reluctantly looked\n",
       "up, and cried:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Thank Heavens, it's gone!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What was it?\" asked the Count.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nothing human,\" replied the Colonel--\"nothing belonging to this world.\n",
       "It was a woman of no earthly type, with a queer-shaped, gleaming face, a\n",
       "mass of red hair, and eyes that would have been beautiful but for their\n",
       "expression, which was hellish. She had on a green hood, after the\n",
       "fashion of an Irish peasant.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "An American lady present suggested that the description tallied with\n",
       "that of the Banshee, upon which the Count said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am an O'Neill--at least I am descended from one. My family name is,\n",
       "as you know, Neilsini, which, little more than a century ago, was\n",
       "O'Neill. My great-grandfather served in the Irish Brigade, and on its\n",
       "dissolution at the time of the French Revolution had the good fortune to\n",
       "escape the general massacre of officers, and in company with an O'Brien\n",
       "and a Maguire fled across the frontier and settled in Italy. On his\n",
       "death his son, who had been born in Italy, and was far more Italian than\n",
       "Irish, changed his name to Neilsini, by which name the family has been\n",
       "known ever since. But for all that we are Irish.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The Banshee was yours, then!\" ejaculated the Colonel. \"What exactly\n",
       "does it mean?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It means,\" the Count replied solemnly, \"the death of some one very\n",
       "nearly associated with me. Pray Heaven it is not my wife or daughter.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "On that score, however, his anxiety was speedily removed, for within two\n",
       "hours he was seized with a violent attack of angina pectoris, and died\n",
       "before morning.[H]\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Elliott O'Donnell, to whose article on \"Banshees\" we are indebted\n",
       "for the above, adds: \"The Banshee never manifests itself to the person\n",
       "whose death it is prognosticating. Other people may see or hear it, but\n",
       "the fated one never, so that when every one present is aware of it but\n",
       "one, the fate of that one may be regarded as pretty well certain.\"\n",

       "that every day that passes after the ordinary man reaches the\n",

       "reaches his prime, and remains, we say, in his prime, for ten years, or\n",
       "perhaps twenty. But after his primest prime is reached, he slowly,\n",
       "insensibly weakens. These are the signs of age in you, in your body, in\n",
       "your art probably, in your mind. You are less electric than you were.\n",

       "\n",
       "The stars had begun to appear in the blue velvet of the sky, and to the\n",
       "east the horizon seen above the black silhouette of the village was\n",
       "growing dove-colored with the approach of moon-rise. White moths hovered\n",
       "dimly over the garden-beds, and the footsteps of night tip-toed through\n",
       "the bushes. Suddenly Frank rose.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, it is the supreme moment,\" he said softly. \"Now more than at any\n",

       "\n",
       "He advanced to the edge of the terrace and looked out standing stretched\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Years ago, do you remember,\" he said, \"we used often to talk about the\n",
       "decay of joy in the world. Many impulses, we settled, had contributed to\n",
       "this decay, some of which were good in themselves, others that were\n",
       "quite completely bad. Among the good things, I put what we may call\n",
       "certain Christian virtues, renunciation, resignation, sympathy with\n",
       "suffering, and the desire to relieve sufferers. But out of those things\n",
       "spring very bad ones, useless renunciations, asceticism for its own\n",
       "sake, mortification of the flesh with nothing to follow, no\n",
       "corresponding gain that is, and that awful and terrible disease which\n",
       "devastated England some centuries ago, and from which by heredity of\n",
       "spirit we suffer now, Puritanism. That was a dreadful plague, the brutes\n",
       "held and taught that joy and laughter and merriment were evil: it was a\n",
       "doctrine the most profane and wicked. Why, what is the commonest crime\n",
       "one sees? A sullen face. That is the truth of the matter.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Now all my life I have believed that we are intended to be happy, that\n",
       "joy is of all gifts the most divine. And when I left London, abandoned\n",
       "my career, such as it was, I did so because I intended to devote my life\n",
       "to the cultivation of joy, and, by continuous and unsparing effort, to\n",
       "be happy. Among people, and in constant intercourse with others, I did\n",
       "not find it possible; there were too many distractions in towns and\n",
       "work-rooms, and also too much suffering. So I took one step backwards or\n",
       "forwards, as you may choose to put it, and went straight to Nature, to\n",
       "trees, birds, animals, to all those things which quite clearly pursue\n",
       "one aim only, which blindly follow the great native instinct to be\n",
       "happy without any care at all for morality, or human law or divine law.\n",
       "I wanted, you understand, to get all joy first-hand and unadulterated,\n",
       "and I think it scarcely exists among men; it is obsolete.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Darcy turned in his chair.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, but what makes birds and animals happy?\" he asked. \"Food, food and\n",

       "\"Do not think I became a sensualist,\" he said. \"I did not make that\n",
       "mistake. For the sensualist carries his miseries pick-a-back, and round\n",
       "his feet is wound the shroud that shall soon enwrap him. I may be mad,\n",
       "it is true, but I am not so stupid anyhow as to have tried that. No,\n",
       "what is it that makes puppies play with their own tails, that sends cats\n",
       "on their prowling ecstatic errands at night?\".\n",
       "\n",
       "He paused a moment.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"So I went to Nature,\" he said. \"I sat down here in this New Forest,\n",
       "sat down fair and square, and looked. That was my first difficulty, to\n",
       "sit here quiet without being bored, to wait without being impatient, to\n",
       "be receptive and very alert, though for a long time nothing particular\n",
       "happened. The change in fact was slow in those early stages.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nothing happened?\" asked Darcy rather impatiently, with the sturdy\n",
       "revolt against any new idea which to the English mind is synonymous with\n",
       "nonsense. \"Why, what in the world _should_ happen?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Now Frank as he had known him was the most generous but most\n",
       "quick-tempered of mortal men; in other words his anger would flare to a\n",
       "prodigious beacon, under almost no provocation, only to be quenched\n",
       "again under a gust of no less impulsive kindliness. Thus the moment\n",
       "Darcy had spoken, an apology for his hasty question was half-way up his\n",
       "tongue. But there was no need for it to have traveled even so far, for\n",
       "Frank laughed again with kindly, genuine mirth.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, how I should have resented that a few years ago,\" he said. \"Thank\n",
       "goodness that resentment is one of the things I have got rid of.\n",
       "I certainly wish that you should believe my story--in fact, you are\n",
       "going to--but that you at this moment should imply that you do not,\n",
       "does not concern me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, your solitary sojournings have made you inhuman,\" said Darcy, still\n",
       "very English.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, human,\" said Frank. \"Rather more human, at least rather less of an\n",
       "ape.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, that was my first quest,\" he continued, after a moment, \"the\n",
       "deliberate and unswerving pursuit of joy, and my method, the eager\n",
       "contemplation of Nature. As far as motive went, I daresay it was purely\n",
       "selfish, but as far as effect goes, it seems to me about the best thing\n",
       "one can do for one's fellow-creatures, for happiness is more infectious\n",
       "than small-pox. So, as I said, I sat down and waited; I looked at happy\n",
       "things, zealously avoided the sight of anything unhappy, and by degrees\n",
       "a little trickle of the happiness of this blissful world began to filter\n",
       "into me. The trickle grew more abundant, and now, my dear fellow, if I\n",
       "could for a moment divert from me into you one half of the torrent of\n",
       "joy that pours through me day and night, you would throw the world, art,\n",
       "everything aside, and just live, exist. When a man's body dies, it\n",
       "passes into trees and flowers. Well, that is what I have been trying to\n",
       "do with my soul before death.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The servant had brought into the pergola a table with syphons and\n",
       "spirits, and had set a lamp upon it. As Frank spoke he leaned forward\n",
       "towards the other, and Darcy for all his matter-of-fact commonsense\n",
       "could have sworn that his companion's face shone, was luminous in\n",
       "itself. His dark brown eyes glowed from within, the unconscious smile of\n",
       "a child irradiated and transformed his face. Darcy felt suddenly\n",
       "excited, exhilarated.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Go on,\" he said. \"Go on. I can feel you are somehow telling me sober\n",
       "truth. I daresay you are mad; but I don't see that matters.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Frank laughed again.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mad?\" he said. \"Yes, certainly, if you wish. But I prefer to call it\n",
       "sane. However, nothing matters less than what anybody chooses to call\n",
       "things. God never labels his gifts; He just puts them into our hands;\n",
       "just as he put animals in the garden of Eden, for Adam to name if he\n",
       "felt disposed.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"So by the continual observance and study of things that were happy,\"\n",
       "continued he, \"I got happiness, I got joy. But seeking it, as I did,\n",
       "from Nature, I got much more which I did not seek, but stumbled upon\n",
       "originally by accident. It is difficult to explain, but I will try.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"About three years ago I was sitting one morning in a place I will show\n",
       "you to-morrow. It is down by the river brink, very green, dappled with\n",
       "shade and sun, and the river passes there through some little clumps of\n",
       "reeds. Well, as I sat there, doing nothing, but just looking and\n",
       "listening, I heard the sound quite distinctly of some flute-like\n",
       "instrument playing a strange unending melody. I thought at first it was\n",
       "some musical yokel on the highway and did not pay much attention. But\n",
       "before long the strangeness and indescribable beauty of the tune struck\n",
       "me. It never repeated itself, but it never came to an end, phrase after\n",
       "phrase ran its sweet course, it worked gradually and inevitably up to a\n",
       "climax, and having attained it, it went on; another climax was reached\n",
       "and another and another. Then with a sudden gasp of wonder I localized\n",
       "where it came from. It came from the reeds and from the sky and from the\n",
       "trees. It was everywhere, it was the sound of life. It was, my dear\n",
       "Darcy, as the Greeks would have said, it was Pan playing on his pipes,\n",
       "the voice of Nature. It was the life-melody, the world-melody.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Darcy was far too interested to interrupt, though there was a question\n",
       "he would have liked to ask, and Frank went on:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, for the moment I was terrified, terrified with the impotent\n",
       "horror of nightmare, and I stopped my ears and just ran from the place\n",
       "and got back to the house panting, trembling, literally in a panic.\n",
       "Unknowingly, for at that time I only pursued joy, I had begun, since I\n",
       "drew my joy from Nature, to get in touch with Nature. Nature, force,\n",
       "God, call it what you will, had drawn across my face a little gossamer\n",
       "web of essential life. I saw that when I emerged from my terror, and I\n",
       "went very humbly back to where I had heard the Pan-pipes. But it was\n",
       "nearly six months before I heard them again.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why was that?\" asked Darcy.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Surely because I had revolted, rebelled, and worst of all been\n",
       "frightened. For I believe that just as there is nothing in the world\n",
       "which so injures one's body as fear, so there is nothing that so much\n",
       "shuts up the soul. I was afraid, you see, of the one thing in the world\n",
       "which has real existence. No wonder its manifestation was withdrawn.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And after six months?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"After six months one blessed morning I heard the piping again. I wasn't\n",
       "afraid that time. And since then it has grown louder, it has become more\n",
       "constant. I now hear it often, and I can put myself into such an\n",
       "attitude towards Nature that the pipes will almost certainly sound. And\n",
       "never yet have they played the same tune, it is always something new,\n",
       "something fuller, richer, more complete than before.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What do you mean by 'such an attitude towards Nature'?\" asked Darcy.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I can't explain that; but by translating it into a bodily attitude it\n",
       "is this.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Frank sat up for a moment quite straight in his chair, then slowly sunk\n",
       "back with arms outspread and head drooped.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That,\" he said, \"an effortless attitude, but open, resting, receptive.\n",
       "It is just that which you must do with your soul.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Then he sat up again.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"One word more,\" he said, \"and I will bore you no further. Nor unless\n",
       "you ask me questions shall I talk about it again. You will find me, in\n",
       "fact, quite sane in my mode of life. Birds and beasts you will see\n",
       "behaving somewhat intimately to me, like that moor-hen, but that is all.\n",
       "I will walk with you, ride with you, play golf with you, and talk with\n",
       "you on any subject you like. But I wanted you on the threshold to know\n",
       "what has happened to me. And one thing more will happen.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He paused again, and a slight look of fear crossed his eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There will be a final revelation,\" he said, \"a complete and blinding\n",
       "stroke which will throw open to me, once and for all, the full\n",
       "knowledge, the full realization and comprehension that I am one, just as\n",
       "you are, with life. In reality there is no 'me,' no 'you,' no 'it.'\n",
       "Everything is part of the one and only thing which is life. I know that\n",
       "that is so, but the realization of it is not yet mine. But it will be,\n",
       "and on that day, so I take it, I shall see Pan. It may mean death, the\n",
       "death of my body, that is, but I don't care. It may mean immortal,\n",
       "eternal life lived here and now and for ever. Then having gained that,\n",
       "ah, my dear Darcy, I shall preach such a gospel of joy, showing myself\n",
       "as the living proof of the truth, that Puritanism, the dismal religion\n",
       "of sour faces, shall vanish like a breath of smoke, and be dispersed and\n",
       "disappear in the sunlit air. But first the full knowledge must be mine.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Darcy watched his face narrowly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are afraid of that moment,\" he said.\n",
       "\n",
       "Frank smiled at him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Quite true; you are quick to have seen that. But when it comes I hope I\n",
       "shall not be afraid.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "For some little time there was silence; then Darcy rose.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have bewitched me, you extraordinary boy,\" he said. \"You have been\n",
       "telling me a fairy-story, and I find myself saying, 'Promise me it is\n",
       "true.'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I promise you that,\" said the other.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And I know I shan't sleep,\" added Darcy.\n",
       "\n",
       "Frank looked at him with a sort of mild wonder as if he scarcely\n",
       "understood.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, what does that matter?\" he said.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I assure you it does. I am wretched unless I sleep.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Of course I can make you sleep if I want,\" said Frank in a rather bored\n",
       "voice.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, do.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very good: go to bed. I'll come upstairs in ten minutes.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Frank busied himself for a little after the other had gone, moving the\n",
       "table back under the awning of the veranda and quenching the lamp. Then\n",
       "he went with his quick silent tread upstairs and into Darcy's room. The\n",
       "latter was already in bed, but very wide-eyed and wakeful, and Frank\n",
       "with an amused smile of indulgence, as for a fretful child, sat down on\n",
       "the edge of the bed.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Look at me,\" he said, and Darcy looked.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The birds are sleeping in the brake,\" said Frank softly, \"and the winds\n",
       "are asleep. The sea sleeps, and the tides are but the heaving of its\n",
       "breast. The stars swing slow, rocked in the great cradle of the Heavens,\n",
       "and----\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He stopped suddenly, gently blew out Darcy's candle, and left him\n",
       "sleeping.\n",
       "\n",
       "Morning brought to Darcy a flood of hard commonsense, as clear and crisp\n",
       "as the sunshine that filled his room. Slowly as he woke he gathered\n",
       "together the broken threads of the memories of the evening which had\n",
       "ended, so he told himself, in a trick of common hypnotism. That\n",
       "accounted for it all; the whole strange talk he had had was under a\n",
       "spell of suggestion from the extraordinary vivid boy who had once been a\n",
       "man; all his own excitement, his acceptance of the incredible had been\n",
       "merely the effect of a stronger, more potent will imposed on his own.\n",
       "How strong that will was, he guessed from his own instantaneous\n",
       "obedience to Frank's suggestion of sleep. And armed with impenetrable\n",
       "commonsense he came down to breakfast. Frank had already begun, and was\n",
       "consuming a large plateful of porridge and milk with the most prosaic\n",
       "and healthy appetite.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Slept well?\" he asked.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, of course. Where did you learn hypnotism?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"By the side of the river.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You talked an amazing quantity of nonsense last night,\" remarked Darcy,\n",
       "in a voice prickly with reason.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Rather. I felt quite giddy. Look, I remembered to order a dreadful\n",
       "daily paper for you. You can read about money markets or politics or\n",
       "cricket matches.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Darcy looked at him closely. In the morning light Frank looked even\n",
       "fresher, younger, more vital than he had done the night before, and the\n",
       "sight of him somehow dinted Darcy's armor of commonsense.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are the most extraordinary fellow I ever saw,\" he said. \"I want to\n",
       "ask you some more questions.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ask away,\" said Frank.\n",
       "\n",
       "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
       "\n",
       "For the next day or two Darcy plied his friend with many questions,\n",
       "objections and criticisms on the theory of life and gradually got out of\n",
       "him a coherent and complete account of his experience. In brief then,\n",
       "Frank believed that \"by lying naked,\" as he put it, to the force which\n",
       "controls the passage of the stars, the breaking of a wave, the budding\n",
       "of a tree, the love of a youth and maiden, he had succeeded in a way\n",
       "hitherto undreamed of in possessing himself of the essential principle\n",
       "of life. Day by day, so he thought, he was getting nearer to, and in\n",
       "closer union with the great power itself which caused all life to be,\n",
       "the spirit of nature, of force, or the spirit of God. For himself, he\n",
       "confessed to what others would call paganism; it was sufficient for him\n",
       "that there existed a principle of life. He did not worship it, he did\n",
       "not pray to it, he did not praise it. Some of it existed in all human\n",
       "beings, just as it existed in trees and animals; to realize and make\n",
       "living to himself the fact that it was all one, was his sole aim and\n",
       "object.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here perhaps Darcy would put in a word of warning. \"Take care,\" he said.\n",
       "\"To see Pan meant death, did it not?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Frank's eyebrows would rise at this.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What does that matter?\" he said. \"True, the Greeks were always right,\n",
       "and they said so, but there is another possibility. For the nearer I get\n",
       "to it, the more living, the more vital and young I become.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What then do you expect the final revelation will do for you?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have told you,\" said he. \"It will make me immortal.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But it was not so much from speech and argument that Darcy grew to grasp\n",
       "his friend's conception, as from the ordinary conduct of his life. They\n",
       "were passing, for instance, one morning down the village street, when an\n",
       "old woman, very bent and decrepit, but with an extraordinary\n",
       "cheerfulness of face, hobbled out from her cottage. Frank instantly\n",
       "stopped when he saw her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You old darling! How goes it all?\" he said.\n",
       "\n",
       "But she did not answer, her dim old eyes were riveted on his face; she\n",
       "seemed to drink in like a thirsty creature the beautiful radiance which\n",
       "shone there. Suddenly she put her two withered old hands on his\n",
       "shoulders.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You're just the sunshine itself,\" she said, and he kissed her and\n",
       "passed on.\n",
       "\n",
       "But scarcely a hundred yards further a strange contradiction of such\n",
       "tenderness occurred. A child running along the path towards them fell on\n",
       "its face, and set up a dismal cry of fright and pain. A look of horror\n",
       "came into Frank's eyes, and, putting his fingers in his ears, he fled at\n",
       "full speed down the street, and did not pause till he was out of\n",
       "hearing. Darcy, having ascertained that the child was not really hurt,\n",
       "followed him in bewilderment.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Are you without pity then?\" he asked.\n",
       "\n",
       "Frank shook his head impatiently.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Can't you see?\" he asked. \"Can't you understand that that sort of\n",
       "thing, pain, anger, anything unlovely throws me back, retards the\n",
       "coming of the great hour! Perhaps when it comes I shall be able to piece\n",
       "that side of life on to the other, on to the true religion of joy. At\n",
       "present I can't.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But the old woman. Was she not ugly?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Frank's radiance gradually returned.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, no. She was like me. She longed for joy, and knew it when she saw\n",
       "it, the old darling.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Another question suggested itself.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then what about Christianity?\" asked Darcy.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I can't accept it. I can't believe in any creed of which the central\n",
       "doctrine is that God who is Joy should have had to suffer. Perhaps it\n",
       "was so; in some inscrutable way I believe it may have been so, but I\n",
       "don't understand how it was possible. So I leave it alone; my affair is\n",
       "joy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "They had come to the weir above the village, and the thunder of riotous\n",
       "cool water was heavy in the air. Trees dipped into the translucent\n",
       "stream with slender trailing branches, and the meadow where they stood\n",
       "was starred with midsummer blossomings. Larks shot up caroling into the\n",
       "crystal dome of blue, and a thousand voices of June sang round them.\n",
       "Frank, bare-headed as was his wont, with his coat slung over his arm and\n",
       "his shirt sleeves rolled up above the elbow, stood there like some\n",
       "beautiful wild animal with eyes half-shut and mouth half-open, drinking\n",
       "in the scented warmth of the air. Then suddenly he flung himself face\n",
       "downwards on the grass at the edge of the stream, burying his face in\n",
       "the daisies and cowslips, and lay stretched there in wide-armed ecstasy,\n",
       "with his long fingers pressing and stroking the dewy herbs of the field.\n",
       "Never before had Darcy seen him thus fully possessed by his idea; his\n",
       "caressing fingers, his half-buried face pressed close to the grass, even\n",
       "the clothed lines of his figure were instinct with a vitality that\n",
       "somehow was different from that of other men. And some faint glow from\n",
       "it reached Darcy, some thrill, some vibration from that charged\n",
       "recumbent body passed to him, and for a moment he understood as he had\n",
       "not understood before, despite his persistent questions and the candid\n",
       "answers they received, how real, and how realized by Frank, his idea\n",
       "was.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then suddenly the muscles in Frank's neck became stiff and alert, and\n",
       "he half-raised his head, whispering, \"The Pan-pipes, the Pan-pipes.\n",
       "Close, oh, so close.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Very slowly, as if a sudden movement might interrupt the melody, he\n",
       "raised himself and leaned on the elbow of his bent arm. His eyes opened\n",
       "wider, the lower lids drooped as if he focused his eyes on something\n",
       "very far away, and the smile on his face broadened and quivered like\n",

       "paused and panted for the storm. After sunset the remote fires of\n",
       "lightning began to wink and flicker on the horizon, but when bed-time\n",
       "came the storm seemed to have moved no nearer, though a very low\n",
       "unceasing noise of thunder was audible. Weary and oppressed by the\n",

       "\n",
       "He woke suddenly into full consciousness, with the din of some appalling\n",

       "Then for a moment, as he recovered himself from the panic-land which\n",
       "lies between sleeping and waking, there was silence, except for the\n",
       "steady hissing of rain on the shrubs outside his window. But suddenly\n",
       "that silence was shattered and shredded into fragments by a scream from\n",
       "somewhere close at hand outside in the black garden, a scream of supreme\n",
       "and despairing terror. Again, and once again it shrilled up, and then a\n",
       "babble of awful words was interjected. A quivering sobbing voice that he\n",

       "\n",
       "\"My God, oh, my God; oh, Christ!\"\n",
       "\n",

       "again; only the rain hissed on the shrubs.\n",
       "\n",
       "All this was but the affair of a moment, and without pause either to put\n",
       "on clothes or light a candle, Darcy was already fumbling at his\n",

       "an orderly table for breakfast had already been laid, and out on to the\n",
       "terrace. The rain for the moment had been utterly stayed, as if the tap\n",
       "of the heavens had been turned off, and under the lowering black sky,\n",
       "not quite dark, since the moon rode somewhere serene behind the\n",
       "conglomerated thunder-clouds, Darcy stumbled into the garden, followed\n",
       "by the servant with the candle. The monstrous leaping shadow of himself\n",
       "was cast before him on the lawn; lost and wandering odors of rose and\n",
       "lily and damp earth were thick about him, but more pungent was some\n",
       "sharp and acrid smell that suddenly reminded him of a certain châlet in\n",
       "which he had once taken refuge in the Alps. In the blackness of the hazy\n",
       "light from the sky, and the vague tossing of the candle behind him, he\n",
       "saw that the hammock in which Frank so often lay was tenanted. A gleam\n",
       "of white shirt was there, as if a man sitting up in it, but across that\n",
       "there was an obscure dark shadow, and as he approached the acrid odor\n",
       "grew more intense.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was now only some few yards away, when suddenly the black shadow\n",
       "seemed to jump into the air, then came down with tappings of hard hoofs\n",
       "on the brick path that ran down the pergola, and with frolicsome\n",
       "skippings galloped off into the bushes. When that was gone Darcy could\n",
       "see quite clearly that a shirted figure sat up in the hammock. For one\n",
       "moment, from sheer terror of the unseen, he hung on his step, and the\n",
       "servant joining him they walked together to the hammock.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was Frank. He was in shirt and trousers only, and he sat up with\n",
       "braced arms. For one half-second he stared at them, his face a mask of\n",
       "horrible contorted terror. His upper lip was drawn back so that the gums\n",
       "of the teeth appeared, and his eyes were focused not on the two who\n",
       "approached him but on something quite close to him; his nostrils were\n",
       "widely expanded, as if he panted for breath, and terror incarnate and\n",
       "repulsion and deathly anguish ruled dreadful lines on his smooth cheeks\n",
       "and forehead. Then even as they looked the body sank backwards, and the\n",
       "ropes of the hammock wheezed and strained.\n",
       "\n",
       "Darcy lifted him out and carried him indoors. Once he thought there was\n",
       "a faint convulsive stir of the limbs that lay with so dead a weight in\n",
       "his arms, but when they got inside, there was no trace of life. But the\n",
       "look of supreme terror and agony of fear had gone from his face, a boy\n",
       "tired with play but still smiling in his sleep was the burden he laid on\n",
       "the floor. His eyes had closed, and the beautiful mouth lay in smiling\n",
       "curves, even as when a few mornings ago, in the meadow by the weir, it\n",

       "to above the elbow. Later, as they sat and talked after dinner on the\n",
       "close sultriness of the evening, he had unbuttoned the front of his\n",

       "red-coated orderly nor the mid-day gun can break, and change of air far\n",
       "beyond that which any homeward-bound steamer can give me. In the\n",
       "meantime I am resolved to stay where I am; and, in flat defiance of my\n",
       "doctor's orders, to take all the world into my confidence. You shall\n",
       "learn for yourselves the precise nature of my malady; and shall, too,\n",
       "judge for yourselves whether any man born of woman on this weary earth\n",
       "was ever so tormented as I.\n",
       "\n",
       "Speaking now as a condemned criminal might speak ere the drop-bolts are\n",
       "drawn, my story, wild and hideously improbable as it may appear, demands\n",
       "at least attention. That it will ever receive credence I utterly\n",
       "disbelieve. Two months ago I should have scouted as mad or drunk the man\n",
       "who had dared tell me the like. Two months ago I was the happiest man in\n",
       "India. To-day, from Peshawar to the sea, there is no one more wretched.\n",
       "My doctor and I are the only two who know this. His explanation is that\n",
       "my brain, digestion and eyesight are all slightly affected; giving rise\n",
       "to my frequent and persistent \"delusions.\" Delusions, indeed! I call him\n",
       "a fool; but he attends me still with the same unwearied smile, the same\n",
       "bland professional manner, the same neatly-trimmed red whiskers, till I\n",
       "begin to suspect that I am an ungrateful, evil-tempered invalid. But you\n",

       "Three years ago it was my fortune--my great misfortune--to sail from\n",

       "Keith-Wessington, wife of an officer on the Bombay side. It does not in\n",
       "the least concern you to know what manner of woman she was. Be content\n",
       "with the knowledge that, ere the voyage had ended, both she and I were\n",
       "desperately and unreasoningly in love with one another. Heaven knows\n",
       "that I can make the admission now without one particle of vanity. In\n",
       "matters of this sort there is always one who gives and another who\n",
       "accepts. From the first day of our ill-omened attachment, I was\n",
       "conscious that Agnes's passion was a stronger, a more dominant, and--if\n",
       "I may use the expression--a purer sentiment than mine. Whether she\n",
       "recognized the fact then, I do not know. Afterwards it was bitterly\n",
       "plain to both of us.\n",
       "\n",
       "Arrived at Bombay in the spring of the year, we went our respective\n",
       "ways, to meet no more for the next three or four months, when my leave\n",
       "and her love took us both to Simla. There we spent the season together;\n",
       "and there my fire of straw burnt itself out to a pitiful end with the\n",
       "closing year. I attempt no excuse. I make no apology. Mrs. Wessington\n",
       "had given up much for my sake, and was prepared to give up all. From my\n",
       "own lips, in August, 1882, she learnt that I was sick of her presence,\n",
       "tired of her company, and weary of the sound of her voice. Ninety-nine\n",
       "women out of a hundred would have wearied of me as I wearied of them;\n",
       "seventy-five of that number would have promptly avenged themselves by\n",
       "active and obtrusive flirtation with other men. Mrs. Wessington was the\n",
       "hundredth. On her neither my openly-expressed aversion, nor the cutting\n",
       "brutalities with which I garnished our interviews had the least effect.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Jack, darling!\" was her one eternal cuckoo-cry, \"I'm sure it's all a\n",
       "mistake--a hideous mistake; and we'll be good friends again some day.\n",
       "_Please_ forgive me, Jack, dear.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "I was the offender, and I knew it. That knowledge transformed my pity\n",
       "into passive endurance, and, eventually, into blind hate--the same\n",
       "instinct, I suppose, which prompts a man to savagely stamp on the spider\n",
       "he has but half killed. And with this hate in my bosom the season of\n",
       "1882 came to an end.\n",
       "\n",
       "Next year we met again at Simla--she with her monotonous face and timid\n",
       "attempts at reconciliation, and I with loathing of her in every fiber of\n",
       "my frame. Several times I could not avoid meeting her alone; and on each\n",
       "occasion her words were identically the same. Still the unreasoning wail\n",
       "that it was all a \"mistake\"; and still the hope of eventually \"making\n",
       "friends.\" I might have seen, had I cared to look, that that hope only\n",
       "was keeping her alive. She grew more wan and thin month by month. You\n",
       "will agree with me, at least, that such conduct would have driven any\n",
       "one to despair. It was uncalled for, childish, unwomanly. I maintain\n",
       "that she was much to blame. And again, sometimes, in the black,\n",
       "fever-stricken night watches, I have begun to think that I might have\n",
       "been a little kinder to her. But that really _is_ a \"delusion.\" I could\n",
       "not have continued pretending to love her when I didn't; could I? It\n",
       "would have been unfair to us both.\n",
       "\n",
       "Last year we met again--on the same terms as before. The same weary\n",
       "appeals, and the same curt answers from my lips. At least I would make\n",
       "her see how wholly wrong and hopeless were her attempts at resuming the\n",
       "old relationship. As the season wore on, we fell apart--that is to say,\n",
       "she found it difficult to meet me, for I had other and more absorbing\n",
       "interests to attend to. When I think it over quietly in my sick-room,\n",
       "the season of 1884 seems a confused nightmare wherein light and shade\n",
       "were fantastically intermingled--my courtship of little Kitty Mannering;\n",
       "my hopes, doubts and fears; our long rides together; my trembling avowal\n",
       "of attachment; her reply; and now and again a vision of a white face\n",
       "flitting by in the 'rickshaw with the black and white liveries I once\n",
       "watched for so earnestly; the wave of Mrs. Wessington's gloved hand;\n",
       "and, when she met me alone, which was but seldom, the irksome monotony\n",
       "of her appeal. I loved Kitty Mannering, honestly, heartily loved her,\n",
       "and with my love for her grew my hatred for Agnes. In August Kitty and I\n",
       "were engaged. The next day I met those accursed \"magpie\" _jhampanies_ at\n",
       "the back of Jakko, and, moved by some passing sentiment of pity, stopped\n",
       "to tell Mrs. Wessington everything. She knew it already.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"So I hear you're engaged, Jack dear.\" Then, without a moment's pause:\n",
       "\"I'm sure it's all a mistake--a hideous mistake. We shall be as good\n",
       "friends some day, Jack, as we ever were.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "My answer might have made even a man wince. It cut the dying woman\n",
       "before me like the blow of a whip. \"Please forgive me, Jack; I didn't\n",
       "mean to make you angry; but it's true, it's true!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "And Mrs. Wessington broke down completely. I turned away and left her to\n",
       "finish her journey in peace, feeling, but only for a moment or two, that\n",
       "I had been an unutterably mean hound. I looked back, and saw that she\n",
       "had turned her 'rickshaw with the idea, I suppose, of overtaking me.\n",
       "\n",
       "The scene and its surroundings were photographed on my memory. The\n",
       "rain-swept sky (we were at the end of the wet weather), the sodden,\n",
       "dingy pines, the muddy road, and the black powder-riven cliffs formed a\n",
       "gloomy background against which the black and white liveries of the\n",
       "_jhampanies_, the yellow-paneled 'rickshaw and Mrs. Wessington's\n",
       "down-bowed golden head stood out clearly. She was holding her\n",
       "handkerchief in her left hand and was leaning back exhausted against the\n",
       "'rickshaw cushions. I turned my horse up a bypath near the Sanjowlie\n",
       "Reservoir and literally ran away. Once I fancied I heard a faint call of\n",
       "\"Jack!\" This may have been imagination. I never stopped to verify it.\n",
       "Ten minutes later I came across Kitty on horseback; and, in the delight\n",
       "of a long ride with her, forgot all about the interview.\n",
       "\n",
       "A week later Mrs. Wessington died, and the inexpressible burden of her\n",
       "existence was removed from my life. I went Plainsward perfectly happy.\n",
       "Before three months were over I had forgotten all about her, except that\n",
       "at times the discovery of some of her old letters reminded me\n",
       "unpleasantly of our bygone relationship. By January I had disinterred\n",
       "what was left of our correspondence from among my scattered belongings\n",
       "and had burnt it. At the beginning of April of this year, 1885, I was at\n",
       "Simla--semi-deserted Simla--once more, and was deep in lover's talks and\n",
       "walks with Kitty. It was decided that we should be married at the end of\n",
       "June. You will understand, therefore, that, loving Kitty as I did, I am\n",
       "not saying too much when I pronounce myself to have been, at the time,\n",
       "the happiest man in India.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fourteen delightful days passed almost before I noticed their flight.\n",
       "Then, aroused to the sense of what was proper among mortals\n",
       "circumstanced as we were, I pointed out to Kitty that an engagement-ring\n",
       "was the outward and visible sign of her dignity as an engaged girl; and\n",
       "that she must forthwith come to Hamilton's to be measured for one. Up to\n",
       "that moment, I give you my word, we had completely forgotten so trivial\n",
       "a matter. To Hamilton's we accordingly went on the 15th of April, 1885.\n",
       "Remember that--whatever my doctor may say to the contrary--I was then in\n",
       "perfect health, enjoying a well-balanced mind and an absolutely tranquil\n",
       "spirit. Kitty and I entered Hamilton's shop together, and there,\n",
       "regardless of the order of affairs, I measured Kitty's finger for the\n",
       "ring in the presence of the amused assistant. The ring was a sapphire\n",
       "with two diamonds. We then rode out down the slope that leads to the\n",
       "Combermere Bridge and Peliti's shop.\n",
       "\n",
       "While my Waler was cautiously feeling his way over the loose shale, and\n",
       "Kitty was laughing and chattering at my side--while all Simla, that is\n",
       "to say as much of it as had then come from the Plains, was grouped round\n",
       "the Reading-room and Peliti's veranda--I was aware that some one,\n",
       "apparently at a vast distance, was calling me by my Christian name. It\n",
       "struck me that I had heard the voice before, but when and where I could\n",
       "not at once determine. In the short space it took to cover the road\n",
       "between the path from Hamilton's shop and the first plank of the\n",
       "Combermere Bridge I had thought over half-a-dozen people who might have\n",
       "committed such a solecism, and had eventually decided that it must have\n",
       "been some singing in my ears. Immediately opposite Peliti's shop my eye\n",
       "was arrested by the sight of four _jhampanies_ in black and white\n",
       "livery, pulling a yellow-paneled, cheap, bazar 'rickshaw. In a moment my\n",
       "mind flew back to the previous season and Mrs. Wessington with a sense\n",
       "of irritation and disgust. Was it not enough that the woman was dead and\n",
       "done with, without her black and white servitors re-appearing to spoil\n",
       "the day's happiness? Whoever employed them now I thought I would call\n",
       "upon, and ask as a personal favor to change her _jhampanies'_ livery.\n",
       "I would hire the men myself, and, if necessary, buy their coats from off\n",
       "their backs. It is impossible to say here what a flood of undesirable\n",
       "memories their presence evoked.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Kitty,\" I cried, \"there are poor Mrs. Wessington's _jhampanies_ turned\n",
       "up again! I wonder who has them now?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Kitty had known Mrs. Wessington slightly last season, and had always\n",
       "been interested in the sickly woman.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What? Where?\" she asked. \"I can't see them anywhere.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Even as she spoke, her horse, swerving from a laden mule, threw himself\n",
       "directly in front of the advancing 'rickshaw. I had scarcely time to\n",
       "utter a word of warning when, to my unutterable horror, horse and rider\n",
       "passed _through_ men and carriage as if they had been thin air.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What's the matter?\" cried Kitty; \"what made you call out so foolishly,\n",
       "Jack? If I _am_ engaged I don't want all creation to know about it.\n",
       "There was lots of space between the mule and the veranda; and, if you\n",
       "think I can't ride--There!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Whereupon willful Kitty set off, her dainty little head in the air, at a\n",
       "hand-gallop in the direction of the Band-stand; fully expecting, as she\n",
       "herself afterwards told me, that I should follow her. What was the\n",
       "matter? Nothing, indeed. Either that I was mad or drunk, or that Simla\n",
       "was haunted with devils. I reined in my impatient cob, and turned round.\n",
       "The 'rickshaw had turned too, and now stood immediately facing me, near\n",
       "the left railing of the Combermere Bridge.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Jack! Jack, darling.\" (There was no mistake about the words this time:\n",
       "they rang through my brain as if they had been shouted in my ear.) \"It's\n",
       "some hideous mistake, I'm sure. _Please_ forgive me, Jack, and let's be\n",
       "friends again.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The 'rickshaw-hood had fallen back, and inside, as I hope and daily pray\n",
       "for the death I dread by night, sat Mrs. Keith-Wessington, handkerchief\n",
       "in hand, and golden head bowed on her breast.\n",
       "\n",
       "How long I stared motionless I do not know. Finally, I was aroused by my\n",
       "groom taking the Waler's bridle and asking whether I was ill. I tumbled\n",
       "off my horse and dashed, half fainting, into Peliti's for a glass of\n",
       "cherry-brandy. There two or three couples were gathered round the\n",
       "coffee-tables discussing the gossip of the day. Their trivialities were\n",
       "more comforting to me just then than the consolations of religion could\n",
       "have been. I plunged into the midst of the conversation at once;\n",
       "chatted, laughed and jested with a face (when I caught a glimpse of it\n",
       "in a mirror) as white and drawn as that of a corpse. Three or four men\n",
       "noticed my condition; and, evidently setting it down to the results of\n",
       "over many pegs, charitably endeavored to draw me apart from the rest of\n",
       "the loungers. But I refused to be led away. I wanted the company of my\n",
       "kind--as a child rushes into the midst of the dinner-party after a\n",
       "fright in the dark. I must have talked for about ten minutes or so,\n",
       "though it seemed an eternity to me, when I heard Kitty's dear voice\n",
       "outside inquiring for me. In another minute she had entered the shop,\n",
       "prepared to roundly upbraid me for failing so signally in my duties.\n",
       "Something in my face stopped her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why, Jack,\" she cried, \"what _have_ you been doing? What _has_\n",
       "happened? Are you ill?\" Thus driven into a direct lie, I said that the\n",
       "sun had been a little too much for me. It was close upon five o'clock of\n",
       "a cloudy April afternoon, and the sun had been hidden all day. I saw my\n",
       "mistake as soon as the words were out of my mouth: attempted to recover\n",
       "it; blundered hopelessly and followed Kitty, in a regal rage, out of\n",
       "doors, amid the smiles of my acquaintances. I made some excuse (I have\n",
       "forgotten what) on the score of my feeling faint; and cantered away to\n",
       "my hotel, leaving Kitty to finish the ride by herself.\n",
       "\n",
       "In my room I sat down and tried calmly to reason out the matter. Here\n",
       "was I, Theobald Jack Pansay, a well-educated Bengal Civilian in the year\n",
       "of grace 1885, presumably sane, certainly healthy, driven in terror from\n",
       "my sweetheart's side by the apparition of a woman who had been dead and\n",
       "buried eight months ago. These were facts that I could not blink.\n",
       "Nothing was further from my thought than any memory of Mrs. Wessington\n",
       "when Kitty and I left Hamilton's shop. Nothing was more utterly\n",
       "commonplace than the stretch of wall opposite Peliti's. It was broad\n",
       "daylight. The road was full of people; and yet here, look you, in\n",
       "defiance of every law of probability, in direct outrage of Nature's\n",
       "ordinance, there had appeared to me a face from the grave.\n",
       "\n",
       "Kitty's Arab had gone _through_ the 'rickshaw: so that my first hope\n",
       "that some woman marvelously like Mrs. Wessington had hired the carriage\n",
       "and the coolies with their old livery was lost. Again and again I went\n",
       "round this treadmill of thought; and again and again gave up baffled and\n",
       "in despair. The voice was as inexplicable as the apparition. I had\n",
       "originally some wild notion of confiding it all to Kitty; of begging her\n",
       "to marry me at once; and in her arms defying the ghostly occupant of the\n",
       "'rickshaw. \"After all,\" I argued, \"the presence of the 'rickshaw is in\n",
       "itself enough to prove the existence of a spectral illusion. One may see\n",
       "ghosts of men and women, but surely never of coolies and carriages. The\n",
       "whole thing is absurd. Fancy the ghost of a hill-man!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Next morning I sent a penitent note to Kitty, imploring her to overlook\n",
       "my strange conduct of the previous afternoon. My Divinity was still very\n",
       "wroth, and a personal apology was necessary. I explained, with a fluency\n",
       "born of night-long pondering over a falsehood, that I had been attacked\n",
       "with a sudden palpitation of the heart--the result of indigestion. This\n",
       "eminently practical solution had its effect; and Kitty and I rode out\n",
       "that afternoon with the shadow of my first lie dividing us.\n",
       "\n",
       "Nothing would please her save a canter round Jakko. With my nerves still\n",
       "unstrung from the previous night I feebly protested against the notion,\n",
       "suggesting Observatory Hill, Jutogh, the Boileaugunge road--anything\n",
       "rather than the Jakko round. Kitty was angry and a little hurt, so I\n",
       "yielded from fear of provoking further misunderstanding, and we set out\n",
       "together towards Chota Simla. We walked a greater part of the way, and,\n",
       "according to our custom, cantered from a mile or so below the Convent to\n",
       "the stretch of level road by the Sanjowlie Reservoir. The wretched\n",
       "horses appeared to fly, and my heart beat quicker and quicker as we\n",
       "neared the crest of the ascent. My mind had been full of Mrs. Wessington\n",
       "all the afternoon; and every inch of the Jakko road bore witness to our\n",
       "old-time walks and talks. The boulders were full of it; the pines sang\n",
       "it aloud overhead; the rain-fed torrents giggled and chuckled unseen\n",
       "over the shameful story; and the wind in my ears chanted the iniquity\n",
       "aloud.\n",
       "\n",
       "As a fitting climax, in the middle of the level men call the Ladies'\n",
       "Mile, the Horror was awaiting me. No other 'rickshaw was in sight--only\n",
       "the four black and white _jhampanies_, the yellow-paneled carriage, and\n",
       "the golden head of the woman within--all apparently just as I had left\n",
       "them eight months and one fortnight ago! For an instant I fancied that\n",
       "Kitty must see what I saw--we were so marvelously sympathetic in all\n",
       "things. Her next words undeceived me--\"Not a soul in sight! Come along,\n",
       "Jack, and I'll race you to the Reservoir buildings!\" Her wiry little\n",
       "Arab was off like a bird, my Waler following close behind, and in this\n",
       "order we dashed under the cliffs. Half a minute brought us within fifty\n",
       "yards of the 'rickshaw. I pulled my Waler and fell back a little. The\n",
       "'rickshaw was directly in the middle of the road: and once more the Arab\n",
       "passed through it, my horse following. \"Jack, Jack, dear! _Please_\n",
       "forgive me,\" rang with a wail in my ears, and, after an interval: \"It's\n",
       "all a mistake, a hideous mistake!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "I spurred my horse like a man possessed. When I turned my head at the\n",
       "Reservoir works the black and white liveries were still\n",
       "waiting--patiently waiting--under the gray hillside, and the wind\n",
       "brought me a mocking echo of the words I had just heard. Kitty bantered\n",
       "me a good deal on my silence throughout the remainder of the ride. I had\n",
       "been talking up till then wildly and at random. To save my life I could\n",
       "not speak afterwards naturally, and from Sanjowlie to the Church wisely\n",
       "held my tongue.\n",
       "\n",
       "I was to dine with the Mannerings that night and had barely time to\n",
       "canter home to dress. On the road to Elysium Hill I overheard two men\n",
       "talking together in the dusk--\"It's a curious thing,\" said one, \"how\n",
       "completely all trace of it disappeared. You know my wife was insanely\n",
       "fond of the woman (never could see anything in her myself) and wanted\n",
       "me to pick up her old 'rickshaw and coolies if they were to be got for\n",

       "judged rightly, that Kitty knew all; and I staggered back to the side of\n",

       "\"Since he is bound to tell us sooner or later, we'd better be resigned\n",

       "\"Once upon a time,\" began Uncle Larry--\"in fact, a very few years\n",
       "ago--there lived in the thriving town of New York a young American\n",
       "called Duncan--Eliphalet Duncan. Like his name, he was half Yankee and\n",
       "half Scotch, and naturally he was a lawyer, and had come to New York to\n",
       "make his way. His father was a Scotchman, who had come over and settled\n",
       "in Boston, and married a Salem girl. When Eliphalet Duncan was about\n",
       "twenty he lost both of his parents. His father left him with enough\n",
       "money to give him a start, and a strong feeling of pride in his Scotch\n",
       "birth; you see there was a title in the family in Scotland, and although\n",
       "Eliphalet's father was the younger son of a younger son, yet he always\n",
       "remembered, and always bade his only son to remember, that his ancestry\n",
       "was noble. His mother left him her full share of Yankee grit, and a\n",
       "little house in Salem which has belonged to her family for more than two\n",
       "hundred years. She was a Hitchcock, and the Hitchcocks had been settled\n",
       "in Salem since the year 1. It was a great-great-grandfather of Mr.\n",
       "Eliphalet Hitchcock who was foremost in the time of the Salem witchcraft\n",
       "craze. And this little old house which she left to my friend Eliphalet\n",
       "Duncan was haunted.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"By the ghost of one of the witches, of course,\" interrupted Dear Jones.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Now how could it be the ghost of a witch, since the witches were all\n",
       "burned at the stake? You never heard of anybody who was burned having a\n",
       "ghost, did you?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That's an argument in favor of cremation, at any rate,\" replied Jones,\n",
       "evading the direct question.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is, if you don't like ghosts; I do,\" said Baby Van Rensselaer.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And so do I,\" added Uncle Larry. \"I love a ghost as dearly as an\n",
       "Englishman loves a lord.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Go on with your story,\" said the Duchess, majestically overruling all\n",
       "extraneous discussion.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This little old house at Salem was haunted,\" resumed Uncle Larry. \"And\n",
       "by a very distinguished ghost--or at least by a ghost with very\n",
       "remarkable attributes.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What was he like?\" asked Baby Van Rensselaer, with a premonitory shiver\n",
       "of anticipatory delight.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It had a lot of peculiarities. In the first place, it never appeared to\n",
       "the master of the house. Mostly it confined its visitations to unwelcome\n",
       "guests. In the course of the last hundred years it had frightened away\n",
       "four successive mothers-in-law, while never intruding on the head of the\n",
       "household.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I guess that ghost had been one of the boys when he was alive and in\n",
       "the flesh.\" This was Dear Jones's contribution to the telling of the\n",
       "tale.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"In the second place,\" continued Uncle Larry, \"it never frightened\n",
       "anybody the first time it appeared. Only on the second visit were the\n",
       "ghost-seers scared; but then they were scared enough for twice, and they\n",
       "rarely mustered up courage enough to risk a third interview. One of the\n",
       "most curious characteristics of this well-meaning spook was that it had\n",
       "no face--or at least that nobody ever saw its face.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Perhaps he kept his countenance veiled?\" queried the Duchess, who was\n",
       "beginning to remember that she never did like ghost stories.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That was what I was never able to find out. I have asked several people\n",
       "who saw the ghost, and none of them could tell me anything about its\n",
       "face, and yet while in its presence they never noticed its features, and\n",
       "never remarked on their absence or concealment. It was only afterward\n",
       "when they tried to recall calmly all the circumstances of meeting with\n",
       "the mysterious stranger, that they became aware that they had not seen\n",
       "its face. And they could not say whether the features were covered, or\n",
       "whether they were wanting, or what the trouble was. They knew only that\n",
       "the face was never seen. And no matter how often they might see it, they\n",
       "never fathomed this mystery. To this day nobody knows whether the ghost\n",
       "which used to haunt the little old house in Salem had a face, or what\n",
       "manner of face it had.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How awfully weird!\" said Baby Van Rensselaer. \"And why did the ghost go\n",
       "away?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I haven't said it went away,\" answered Uncle Larry, with much dignity.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But you said it _used_ to haunt the little old house at Salem, so I\n",
       "supposed it had moved. Didn't it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You shall be told in due time. Eliphalet Duncan used to spend most of\n",
       "his summer vacations at Salem, and the ghost never bothered him at all,\n",
       "for he was the master of the house--much to his disgust, too, because\n",
       "he wanted to see for himself the mysterious tenant at will of his\n",
       "property. But he never saw it, never. He arranged with friends to call\n",
       "him whenever it might appear, and he slept in the next room with the\n",
       "door open; and yet when their frightened cries waked him the ghost was\n",
       "gone, and his only reward was to hear reproachful sighs as soon as he\n",
       "went back to bed. You see, the ghost thought it was not fair of\n",
       "Eliphalet to seek an introduction which was plainly unwelcome.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Dear Jones interrupted the story-teller by getting up and tucking a\n",
       "heavy rug snugly around Baby Van Rensselaer's feet, for the sky was now\n",
       "overcast and gray, and the air was damp and penetrating.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"One fine spring morning,\" pursued Uncle Larry, \"Eliphalet Duncan\n",
       "received great news. I told you that there was a title in the family in\n",
       "Scotland, and that Eliphalet's father was the younger son of a younger\n",
       "son. Well, it happened that all Eliphalet's father's brothers and uncles\n",
       "had died off without male issue except the eldest son of the eldest, and\n",
       "he, of course, bore the title, and was Baron Duncan of Duncan. Now the\n",
       "great news that Eliphalet Duncan received in New York one fine spring\n",
       "morning was that Baron Duncan and his only son had been yachting in the\n",
       "Hebrides, and they had been caught in a black squall, and they were both\n",
       "dead. So my friend Eliphalet Duncan inherited the title and the\n",
       "estates.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How romantic!\" said the Duchess. \"So he was a baron!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well,\" answered Uncle Larry, \"he was a baron if he chose. But he didn't\n",
       "choose.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"More fool he,\" said Dear Jones sententiously.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well,\" answered Uncle Larry, \"I'm not so sure of that. You see,\n",
       "Eliphalet Duncan was half Scotch and half Yankee, and he had two eyes to\n",
       "the main chance. He held his tongue about his windfall of luck until he\n",
       "could find out whether the Scotch estates were enough to keep up the\n",
       "Scotch title. He soon discovered that they were not, and that the late\n",
       "Lord Duncan, having married money, kept up such state as he could out of\n",
       "the revenues of the dowry of Lady Duncan. And Eliphalet, he decided\n",
       "that he would rather be a well-fed lawyer in New York, living\n",
       "comfortably on his practice, than a starving lord in Scotland, living\n",
       "scantily on his title.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But he kept his title?\" asked the Duchess.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well,\" answered Uncle Larry, \"he kept it quiet. I knew it, and a friend\n",
       "or two more. But Eliphalet was a sight too smart to put Baron Duncan of\n",
       "Duncan, Attorney and Counselor at Law, on his shingle.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What has all this got to do with your ghost?\" asked Dear Jones\n",
       "pertinently.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nothing with that ghost, but a good deal with another ghost. Eliphalet\n",
       "was very learned in spirit lore--perhaps because he owned the haunted\n",
       "house at Salem, perhaps because he was a Scotchman by descent. At all\n",
       "events, he had made a special study of the wraiths and white ladies and\n",
       "banshees and bogies of all kinds whose sayings and doings and warnings\n",
       "are recorded in the annals of the Scottish nobility. In fact, he was\n",
       "acquainted with the habits of every reputable spook in the Scotch\n",
       "peerage. And he knew that there was a Duncan ghost attached to the\n",
       "person of the holder of the title of Baron Duncan of Duncan.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"So, besides being the owner of a haunted house in Salem, he was also a\n",
       "haunted man in Scotland?\" asked Baby Van Rensselaer.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Just so. But the Scotch ghost was not unpleasant, like the Salem ghost,\n",
       "although it had one peculiarity in common with its trans-Atlantic\n",
       "fellow-spook. It never appeared to the holder of the title, just as the\n",
       "other never was visible to the owner of the house. In fact, the Duncan\n",
       "ghost was never seen at all. It was a guardian angel only. Its sole duty\n",
       "was to be in personal attendance on Baron Duncan of Duncan, and to warn\n",
       "him of impending evil. The traditions of the house told that the Barons\n",
       "of Duncan had again and again felt a premonition of ill fortune. Some of\n",
       "them had yielded and withdrawn from the venture they had undertaken, and\n",
       "it had failed dismally. Some had been obstinate, and had hardened their\n",
       "hearts, and had gone on reckless of defeat and to death. In no case had\n",
       "a Lord Duncan been exposed to peril without fair warning.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then how came it that the father and son were lost in the yacht off the\n",
       "Hebrides?\" asked Dear Jones.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Because they were too enlightened to yield to superstition. There is\n",
       "extant now a letter of Lord Duncan, written to his wife a few minutes\n",
       "before he and his son set sail, in which he tells her how hard he has\n",
       "had to struggle with an almost overmastering desire to give up the trip.\n",
       "Had he obeyed the friendly warning of the family ghost, the latter would\n",
       "have been spared a journey across the Atlantic.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Did the ghost leave Scotland for America as soon as the old baron\n",
       "died?\" asked Baby Van Rensselaer, with much interest.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How did he come over,\" queried Dear Jones--\"in the steerage, or as a\n",
       "cabin passenger?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I don't know,\" answered Uncle Larry calmly, \"and Eliphalet, he didn't\n",
       "know. For as he was in no danger, and stood in no need of warning, he\n",
       "couldn't tell whether the ghost was on duty or not. Of course he was on\n",
       "the watch for it all the time. But he never got any proof of its\n",
       "presence until he went down to the little old house of Salem, just\n",
       "before the Fourth of July. He took a friend down with him--a young\n",
       "fellow who had been in the regular army since the day Fort Sumter was\n",
       "fired on, and who thought that after four years of the little\n",
       "unpleasantness down South, including six months in Libby, and after ten\n",
       "years of fighting the bad Indians on the plains, he wasn't likely to be\n",
       "much frightened by a ghost. Well, Eliphalet and the officer sat out on\n",
       "the porch all the evening smoking and talking over points in military\n",
       "law. A little after twelve o'clock, just as they began to think it was\n",
       "about time to turn in, they heard the most ghastly noise in the house.\n",
       "It wasn't a shriek, or a howl, or a yell, or anything they could put a\n",
       "name to. It was an undeterminate, inexplicable shiver and shudder of\n",
       "sound, which went wailing out of the window. The officer had been at\n",
       "Cold Harbor, but he felt himself getting colder this time. Eliphalet\n",
       "knew it was the ghost who haunted the house. As this weird sound died\n",
       "away, it was followed by another, sharp, short, blood-curdling in its\n",
       "intensity. Something in this cry seemed familiar to Eliphalet, and he\n",
       "felt sure that it proceeded from the family ghost, the warning wraith\n",
       "of the Duncans.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do I understand you to intimate that both ghosts were there together?\"\n",
       "inquired the Duchess anxiously.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Both of them were there,\" answered Uncle Larry. \"You see, one of them\n",
       "belonged to the house, and had to be there all the time, and the other\n",
       "was attached to the person of Baron Duncan, and had to follow him there;\n",
       "wherever he was there was the ghost also. But Eliphalet, he had scarcely\n",
       "time to think this out when he heard both sounds again, not one after\n",
       "another, but both together, and something told him--some sort of an\n",
       "instinct he had--that those two ghosts didn't agree, didn't get on\n",
       "together, didn't exactly hit it off; in fact, that they were\n",
       "quarreling.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Quarreling ghosts! Well, I never!\" was Baby Van Rensselaer's remark.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is a blessed thing to see ghosts dwell together in unity,\" said Dear\n",
       "Jones.\n",
       "\n",
       "And the Duchess added, \"It would certainly be setting a better example.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You know,\" resumed Uncle Larry, \"that two waves of light or of sound\n",
       "may interfere and produce darkness or silence. So it was with these\n",
       "rival spooks. They interfered, but they did not produce silence or\n",
       "darkness. On the contrary, as soon as Eliphalet and the officer went\n",
       "into the house, there began at once a series of spiritualistic\n",
       "manifestations, a regular dark séance. A tambourine was played upon, a\n",
       "bell was rung, and a flaming banjo went singing around the room.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Where did they get the banjo?\" asked Dear Jones skeptically.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I don't know. Materialized it, maybe, just as they did the tambourine.\n",
       "You don't suppose a quiet New York lawyer kept a stock of musical\n",
       "instruments large enough to fit out a strolling minstrel troupe just on\n",
       "the chance of a pair of ghosts coming to give him a surprise party, do\n",
       "you? Every spook has its own instrument of torture. Angels play on\n",
       "harps, I'm informed, and spirits delight in banjos and tambourines.\n",
       "These spooks of Eliphalet Duncan's were ghosts with all the modern\n",
       "improvements, and I guess they were capable of providing their own\n",
       "musical weapons. At all events, they had them there in the little old\n",
       "house at Salem the night Eliphalet and his friend came down. And they\n",
       "played on them, and they rang the bell, and they rapped here, there, and\n",
       "everywhere. And they kept it up all night.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"All night?\" asked the awe-stricken Duchess.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"All night long,\" said Uncle Larry solemnly; \"and the next night, too.\n",
       "Eliphalet did not get a wink of sleep, neither did his friend. On the\n",
       "second night the house ghost was seen by the officer; on the third night\n",
       "it showed itself again; and the next morning the officer packed his\n",
       "grip-sack and took the first train to Boston. He was a New Yorker, but\n",
       "he said he'd sooner go to Boston than see that ghost again. Eliphalet,\n",
       "he wasn't scared at all, partly because he never saw either the\n",
       "domiciliary or the titular spook, and partly because he felt himself on\n",
       "friendly terms with the spirit world, and didn't scare easily. But after\n",
       "losing three nights' sleep and the society of his friend, he began to be\n",
       "a little impatient, and to think that the thing had gone far enough. You\n",
       "see, while in a way he was fond of ghosts, yet he liked them best one at\n",
       "a time. Two ghosts were one too many. He wasn't bent on making a\n",
       "collection of spooks. He and one ghost were company, but he and two\n",
       "ghosts were a crowd.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What did he do?\" asked Baby Van Rensselaer.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, he couldn't do anything. He waited awhile, hoping they would get\n",
       "tired; but he got tired out first. You see, it comes natural to a spook\n",
       "to sleep in the daytime, but a man wants to sleep nights, and they\n",
       "wouldn't let him sleep nights. They kept on wrangling and quarreling\n",
       "incessantly; they manifested and they dark-séanced as regularly as the\n",
       "old clock on the stairs struck twelve; they rapped and they rang bells\n",
       "and they banged the tambourine and they threw the flaming banjo about\n",
       "the house, and worse than all, they swore.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I did not know that spirits were addicted to bad language,\" said the\n",
       "Duchess.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How did he know they were swearing? Could he hear them?\" asked Dear\n",
       "Jones.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That was just it,\" responded Uncle Larry; \"he could not hear them--at\n",
       "least not distinctly. There were inarticulate murmurs and stifled\n",
       "rumblings. But the impression produced on him was that they were\n",
       "swearing. If they had only sworn right out, he would not have minded it\n",
       "so much, because he would have known the worst. But the feeling that the\n",
       "air was full of suppressed profanity was very wearing and after standing\n",
       "it for a week, he gave up in disgust and went to the White Mountains.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Leaving them to fight it out, I suppose,\" interjected Baby Van\n",
       "Rensselaer.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not at all,\" explained Uncle Larry. \"They could not quarrel unless he\n",
       "was present. You see, he could not leave the titular ghost behind him,\n",
       "and the domiciliary ghost could not leave the house. When he went away\n",
       "he took the family ghost with him, leaving the house ghost behind. Now\n",
       "spooks can't quarrel when they are a hundred miles apart any more than\n",
       "men can.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And what happened afterward?\" asked Baby Van Rensselaer, with a pretty\n",
       "impatience.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A most marvelous thing happened. Eliphalet Duncan went to the White\n",
       "Mountains, and in the car of the railroad that runs to the top of Mount\n",
       "Washington he met a classmate whom he had not seen for years, and this\n",
       "classmate introduced Duncan to his sister, and this sister was a\n",
       "remarkably pretty girl, and Duncan fell in love with her at first sight,\n",
       "and by the time he got to the top of Mount Washington he was so deep in\n",
       "love that he began to consider his own unworthiness, and to wonder\n",
       "whether she might ever be induced to care for him a little--ever so\n",
       "little.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I don't think that is so marvelous a thing,\" said Dear Jones glancing\n",
       "at Baby Van Rensselaer.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Who was she?\" asked the Duchess, who had once lived in Philadelphia.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She was Miss Kitty Sutton, of San Francisco, and she was a daughter of\n",
       "old Judge Sutton, of the firm of Pixley and Sutton.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A very respectable family,\" assented the Duchess.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I hope she wasn't a daughter of that loud and vulgar old Mrs. Sutton\n",
       "whom I met at Saratoga, one summer, four or five years ago?\" said Dear\n",
       "Jones.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Probably she was.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She was a horrid old woman. The boys used to call her Mother Gorgon.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The pretty Kitty Sutton with whom Eliphalet Duncan had fallen in love\n",
       "was the daughter of Mother Gorgon. But he never saw the mother, who was\n",
       "in 'Frisco, or Los Angeles, or Santa Fe, or somewhere out West, and he\n",
       "saw a great deal of the daughter, who was up in the White Mountains. She\n",
       "was traveling with her brother and his wife, and as they journeyed from\n",
       "hotel to hotel, Duncan went with them, and filled out the quartette.\n",
       "Before the end of the summer he began to think about proposing. Of\n",
       "course he had lots of chances, going on excursions as they were every\n",
       "day. He made up his mind to seize the first opportunity, and that very\n",
       "evening he took her out for a moonlight row on Lake Winnipiseogee. As he\n",
       "handed her into the boat he resolved to do it, and he had a glimmer of a\n",
       "suspicion that she knew he was going to do it, too.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Girls,\" said Dear Jones, \"never go out in a rowboat at night with a\n",
       "young man unless you mean to accept him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Sometimes it's best to refuse him, and get it over once for all,\" said\n",
       "Baby Van Rensselaer.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"As Eliphalet took the oars he felt a sudden chill. He tried to shake it\n",
       "off, but in vain. He began to have a growing consciousness of impending\n",
       "evil. Before he had taken ten strokes--and he was a swift oarsman--he\n",
       "was aware of a mysterious presence between him and Miss Sutton.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Was it the guardian-angel ghost warning him off the match?\" interrupted\n",
       "Dear Jones.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That's just what it was,\" said Uncle Larry. \"And he yielded to it, and\n",
       "kept his peace, and rowed Miss Sutton back to the hotel with his\n",
       "proposal unspoken.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"More fool he,\" said Dear Jones. \"It will take more than one ghost to\n",
       "keep me from proposing when my mind is made up.\" And he looked at Baby\n",
       "Van Rensselaer.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The next morning,\" continued Uncle Larry, \"Eliphalet overslept\n",
       "himself, and when he went down to a late breakfast he found that the\n",
       "Suttons had gone to New York by the morning train. He wanted to follow\n",
       "them at once, and again he felt the mysterious presence overpowering his\n",
       "will. He struggled two days, and at last he roused himself to do what he\n",
       "wanted in spite of the spook. When he arrived in New York it was late in\n",
       "the evening. He dressed himself hastily and went to the hotel where the\n",
       "Suttons put up, in the hope of seeing at least her brother. The guardian\n",
       "angel fought every inch of the walk with him, until he began to wonder\n",
       "whether, if Miss Sutton were to take him, the spook would forbid the\n",
       "banns. At the hotel he saw no one that night, and he went home\n",
       "determined to call as early as he could the next afternoon, and make an\n",
       "end of it. When he left his office about two o'clock the next day to\n",
       "learn his fate, he had not walked five blocks before he discovered that\n",
       "the wraith of the Duncans had withdrawn his opposition to the suit.\n",
       "There was no feeling of impending evil, no resistance, no struggle, no\n",
       "consciousness of an opposing presence. Eliphalet was greatly encouraged.\n",
       "He walked briskly to the hotel; he found Miss Sutton alone. He asked her\n",
       "the question, and got his answer.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She accepted him, of course,\" said Baby Van Rensselaer.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Of course,\" said Uncle Larry. \"And while they were in the first flush\n",
       "of joy, swapping confidences and confessions, her brother came into the\n",
       "parlor with an expression of pain on his face and a telegram in his\n",
       "hand. The former was caused by the latter, which was from 'Frisco, and\n",
       "which announced the sudden death of Mrs. Sutton, their mother.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And that was why the ghost no longer opposed the match?\" questioned\n",
       "Dear Jones.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Exactly. You see, the family ghost knew that Mother Gorgon was an awful\n",
       "obstacle to Duncan's happiness, so it warned him. But the moment the\n",
       "obstacle was removed, it gave its consent at once.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The fog was lowering its thick damp curtain, and it was beginning to be\n",
       "difficult to see from one end of the boat to the other. Dear Jones\n",
       "tightened the rug which enwrapped Baby Van Rensselaer, and then withdrew\n",
       "again into his own substantial coverings.\n",
       "\n",
       "Uncle Larry paused in his story long enough to light another of the tiny\n",
       "cigars he always smoked.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I infer that Lord Duncan\"--the Duchess was scrupulous in the bestowal\n",
       "of titles--\"saw no more of the ghosts after he was married.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He never saw them at all, at any time, either before or since. But they\n",
       "came very near breaking off the match, and thus breaking two young\n",
       "hearts.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You don't mean to say that they knew any just cause or impediment why\n",
       "they should not forever after hold their peace?\" asked Dear Jones.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How could a ghost, or even two ghosts, keep a girl from marrying the\n",
       "man she loved?\" This was Baby Van Rensselaer's question.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It seems curious, doesn't it?\" and Uncle Larry tried to warm himself by\n",
       "two or three sharp pulls at his fiery little cigar. \"And the\n",
       "circumstances are quite as curious as the fact itself. You see, Miss\n",
       "Sutton wouldn't be married for a year after her mother's death, so she\n",
       "and Duncan had lots of time to tell each other all they knew. Eliphalet,\n",
       "he got to know a good deal about the girls she went to school with, and\n",
       "Kitty, she learned all about his family. He didn't tell her about the\n",
       "title for a long time, as he wasn't one to brag. But he described to her\n",
       "the little old house at Salem. And one evening toward the end of the\n",
       "summer, the wedding-day having been appointed for early in September,\n",
       "she told him that she didn't want to bridal tour at all; she just wanted\n",
       "to go down to the little old house at Salem to spend her honeymoon in\n",
       "peace and quiet, with nothing to do and nobody to bother them. Well,\n",
       "Eliphalet jumped at the suggestion. It suited him down to the ground.\n",
       "All of a sudden he remembered the spooks, and it knocked him all of a\n",
       "heap. He had told her about the Duncan Banshee, and the idea of having\n",
       "an ancestral ghost in personal attendance on her husband tickled her\n",
       "immensely. But he had never said anything about the ghost which haunted\n",
       "the little old house at Salem. He knew she would be frightened out of\n",
       "her wits if the house ghost revealed itself to her, and he saw at once\n",
       "that it would be impossible to go to Salem on their wedding trip. So he\n",
       "told her all about it, and how whenever he went to Salem the two ghosts\n",
       "interfered, and gave dark séances and manifested and materialized and\n",
       "made the place absolutely impossible. Kitty, she listened in silence,\n",
       "and Eliphalet, he thought she had changed her mind. But she hadn't done\n",
       "anything of the kind.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Just like a man--to think she was going to,\" remarked Baby Van\n",

       "\"Just like a girl--to be so inconsistent,\" remarked Dear Jones.\n",
       "\n",
       "Uncle Larry's tiny cigar had long been extinct. He lighted a new one,\n",
       "and continued: \"Eliphalet protested in vain. Kitty said her mind was\n",
       "made up. She was determined to pass her honeymoon in the little old\n",
       "house at Salem, and she was equally determined not to go there as long\n",
       "as there were any ghosts there. Until he could assure her that the\n",
       "spectral tenants had received notice to quit, and that there was no\n",
       "danger of manifestations and materializing, she refused to be married at\n",
       "all. She did not intend to have her honeymoon interrupted by two\n",
       "wrangling ghosts, and the wedding could be postponed until he had made\n",
       "ready the house for her.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Well, that's what Eliphalet thought, much as he was in love with her.\n",
       "And he believed he could talk her out of her determination. But he\n",
       "couldn't. She was set. And when a girl is set, there's nothing to do but\n",
       "yield to the inevitable. And that's just what Eliphalet did. He saw he\n",
       "would either have to give her up or to get the ghosts out; and as he\n",
       "loved her and did not care for the ghosts, he resolved to tackle the\n",
       "ghosts. He had clear grit, Eliphalet had--he was half Scotch and half\n",
       "Yankee, and neither breed turns tail in a hurry. So he made his plans\n",
       "and he went down to Salem. As he said good-by to Kitty he had an\n",
       "impression that she was sorry she had made him go, but she kept up\n",
       "bravely, and put a bold face on it, and saw him off, and went home and\n",
       "cried for an hour, and was perfectly miserable until he came back the\n",
       "next day.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Did he succeed in driving the ghosts away?\" asked Baby Van Rensselaer,\n",

       "\n",
       "\"That's just what I'm coming to,\" said Uncle Larry, pausing at the\n",
       "critical moment, in the manner of the trained story teller. \"You see,\n",
       "Eliphalet had got a rather tough job, and he would gladly have had an\n",
       "extension of time on the contract, but he had to choose between the girl\n",
       "and the ghosts, and he wanted the girl. He tried to invent or remember\n",
       "some short and easy way with ghosts, but he couldn't. He wished that\n",
       "somebody had invented a specific for spooks--something that would make\n",
       "the ghosts come out of the house and die in the yard. He wondered if he\n",
       "could not tempt the ghosts to run in debt, so that he might get the\n",
       "sheriff to help him. He wondered also whether the ghosts could not be\n",
       "overcome with strong drink--a dissipated spook, a spook with delirium\n",
       "tremens, might be committed to the inebriate asylum. But none of these\n",
       "things seemed feasible.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What did he do?\" interrupted Dear Jones. \"The learned counsel will\n",
       "please speak to the point.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "And Uncle Larry proceeded:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Eliphalet went down to the little old house at Salem, and as soon as\n",
       "the clock struck twelve the rival ghosts began wrangling as before. Raps\n",
       "here, there, and everywhere, ringing bells, banging tambourines,\n",
       "strumming banjos sailing about the room, and all the other\n",
       "manifestations and materializations followed one another just as they\n",
       "had the summer before. The only difference Eliphalet could detect was a\n",
       "stronger flavor in the spectral profanity; and this, of course, was only\n",
       "a vague impression, for he did not actually hear a single word. He\n",
       "waited awhile in patience, listening and watching. Of course he never\n",
       "saw either of the ghosts, because neither of them could appear to him.\n",
       "At last he got his dander up, and he thought it was about time to\n",
       "interfere, so he rapped on the table, and asked for silence. As soon as\n",
       "he felt that the spooks were listening to him he explained the situation\n",
       "to them. He told them he was in love, and that he could not marry unless\n",
       "they vacated the house. He appealed to them as old friends, and he laid\n",
       "claim to their gratitude. The titular ghost had been sheltered by the\n",
       "Duncan family for hundreds of years, and the domiciliary ghost had had\n",
       "free lodging in the little old house at Salem for nearly two centuries.\n",
       "He implored them to settle their differences, and to get him out of his\n",
       "difficulty at once. He suggested they'd better fight it out then and\n",
       "there, and see who was master. He had brought down with him all needful\n",
       "weapons. And he pulled out his valise, and spread on the table a pair of\n",
       "navy revolvers, a pair of shot-guns, a pair of dueling swords, and a\n",
       "couple of bowie-knives. He offered to serve as second for both parties,\n",
       "and to give the word when to begin. He also took out of his valise a\n",
       "pack of cards and a bottle of poison, telling them that if they wished\n",
       "to avoid carnage they might cut the cards to see which one should take\n",
       "the poison. Then he waited anxiously for their reply. For a little space\n",
       "there was silence. Then he became conscious of a tremulous shivering in\n",
       "one corner of the room, and he remembered that he had heard from that\n",
       "direction what sounded like a frightened sigh when he made the first\n",
       "suggestion of the duel. Something told him that this was the domiciliary\n",
       "ghost, and that it was badly scared. Then he was impressed by a certain\n",
       "movement in the opposite corner of the room, as though the titular ghost\n",
       "were drawing himself up with offended dignity. Eliphalet couldn't\n",
       "exactly see these things, because he never saw the ghosts, but he felt\n",
       "them. After a silence of nearly a minute a voice came from the corner\n",
       "where the family ghost stood--a voice strong and full, but trembling\n",
       "slightly with suppressed passion. And this voice told Eliphalet it was\n",
       "plain enough that he had not long been the head of the Duncans, and that\n",
       "he had never properly considered the characteristics of his race if now\n",
       "he supposed that one of his blood could draw his sword against a woman.\n",
       "Eliphalet said he had never suggested that the Duncan ghost should raise\n",
       "his hand against a woman and all he wanted was that the Duncan ghost\n",
       "should fight the other ghost. And then the voice told Eliphalet that the\n",
       "other ghost was a woman.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What?\" said Dear Jones, sitting up suddenly. \"You don't mean to tell me\n",
       "that the ghost which haunted the house was a woman?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Those were the very words Eliphalet Duncan used,\" said Uncle Larry;\n",
       "\"but he did not need to wait for the answer. All at once he recalled the\n",
       "traditions about the domiciliary ghost, and he knew that what the\n",
       "titular ghost said was the fact. He had never thought of the sex of a\n",
       "spook, but there was no doubt whatever that the house ghost was a woman.\n",
       "No sooner was this firmly fixed in Eliphalet's mind than he saw his way\n",
       "out of the difficulty. The ghosts must be married!--for then there would\n",
       "be no more interference, no more quarreling, no more manifestations and\n",
       "materializations, no more dark séances, with their raps and bells and\n",
       "tambourines and banjos. At first the ghosts would not hear of it. The\n",
       "voice in the corner declared that the Duncan wraith had never thought of\n",
       "matrimony. But Eliphalet argued with them, and pleaded and persuaded and\n",
       "coaxed, and dwelt on the advantages of matrimony. He had to confess, of\n",
       "course, that he did not know how to get a clergyman to marry them; but\n",
       "the voice from the corner gravely told him that there need be no\n",
       "difficulty in regard to that, as there was no lack of spiritual\n",
       "chaplains. Then, for the first time, the house ghost spoke, in a low,\n",
       "clear, gentle voice, and with a quaint, old-fashioned New England\n",
       "accent, which contrasted sharply with the broad Scotch speech of the\n",
       "family ghost. She said that Eliphalet Duncan seemed to have forgotten\n",
       "that she was married. But this did not upset Eliphalet at all; he\n",
       "remembered the whole case clearly, and he told her she was not a married\n",
       "ghost, but a widow, since her husband had been hung for murdering her.\n",
       "Then the Duncan ghost drew attention to the great disparity of their\n",
       "ages, saying that he was nearly four hundred and fifty years old, while\n",
       "she was barely two hundred. But Eliphalet had not talked to juries for\n",
       "nothing; he just buckled to, and coaxed those ghosts into matrimony.\n",
       "Afterward he came to the conclusion that they were willing to be coaxed,\n",
       "but at the time he thought he had pretty hard work to convince them of\n",
       "the advantages of the plan.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Did he succeed?\" asked Baby Van Rensselaer, with a young lady's\n",

       "\n",
       "\"He did,\" said Uncle Larry. \"He talked the wraith of the Duncans and the\n",

       "And from the time they were engaged he had no more trouble with them.\n",
       "They were rival ghosts no longer. They were married by their spiritual\n",

       "front of the railing of Grace Church. The ghostly bride and bridegroom\n",

       "Mrs. Wilton passed through a little alley leading from one of the gates\n",
       "which are around Regent's Park, and came out on the wide and quiet\n",
       "street. She walked along slowly, peering anxiously from side to side so\n",
       "as not to overlook the number. She pulled her furs closer round her;\n",
       "after her years in India this London damp seemed very harsh. Still, it\n",
       "was not a fog to-day. A dense haze, gray and tinged ruddy, lay between\n",
       "the houses, sometimes blowing with a little wet kiss against the face.\n",
       "Mrs. Wilton's hair and eyelashes and her furs were powdered with tiny\n",

       "suggestion of the office or waiting-room where people came and went all\n",
       "day; yet you would not say that it was a private room which was lived\n",
       "in. There were no books or papers about; every chair was in the place it\n",

       "it was only he who had told her anything definite. But even he could do\n",
       "no more than tell the past. He told of her marriage; he even had the\n",
       "duration of it right--twenty-one months. He told too of their time in\n",
       "India--at least, he knew that her husband had been a soldier, and said\n",
       "he had been on service in the \"colonies.\" On the whole, though, he had\n",
       "been as unsatisfactory as the others. None of them had given her the\n",
       "consolation she sought. She did not want to be told of the past. If Hugh\n",
       "was gone forever, then with him had gone all her love of living, her\n",
       "courage, all her better self. She wanted to be lifted out of the\n",
       "despair, the dazed aimless drifting from day to day, longing at night\n",
       "for the morning, and in the morning for the fall of night, which had\n",
       "been her life since his death. If somebody could assure her that it was\n",
       "not all over, that he was somewhere, not too far away, unchanged from\n",
       "what he had been here, with his crisp hair and rather slow smile and\n",

       "of seers and fortune-tellers of all kinds, she saw at once that this\n",
       "woman was different from the others. She was used to the quick\n",
       "appraising look, the attempts, sometimes clumsy, but often cleverly\n",
       "disguised, to collect some fragments of information whereupon to erect a\n",
       "plausible vision. But this woman looked as if she took it out of\n",

       "\n",
       "Not that her appearance suggested intercourse with the spiritual world\n",
       "more than the others had done; it suggested that, in fact, considerably\n",

       "He might well sup with the devil, that man, and probably did in some way\n",

       "\n",

       "her with some embarrassment. It seemed more reasonable to be asking a\n",
       "woman like this about altering a gown than about intercourse with the\n",
       "dead. That seemed even absurd in such a very commonplace presence. The\n",

       "signs of nervous exhaustion suggested overwork in a close atmosphere,\n",
       "bending too close over the sewing-machine. Her uninteresting hair, like\n",

       "very slowly and her voice was guttural.\n",
       "\n",

       "This was a frequent gesture of Hugh's. And indeed at that moment she\n",
       "felt that somebody was very near her, bending over her. She was\n",
       "enveloped in tenderness. Only a very thin veil, she felt, prevented her\n",
       "from seeing. But the woman saw. She was describing Hugh minutely, even\n",

       "\n",
       "\"He loves you. He won't answer, but he loves you. He wants me to make\n",

       "for her meals now: she had developed an exhausting cough, and she found\n",
       "that it somehow became less troublesome when she was in a public place\n",
       "looking at strange faces. In her flat there were all the things that\n",
       "Hugh had used; the trunks and bags still had his name on them with the\n",

       "\"This relation is matter of fact, and attended with such circumstances,\\nas may induce any reasonable man to believe it. It was sent by a\\ngentleman, a justice of peace, at Maidstone, in Kent, and a very\\nintelligent person, to his friend in London, as it is here worded; which\\ndiscourse is attested by a very sober and understanding gentlewoman, a\\nkinswoman of the said gentleman's, who lives in Canterbury, within a few\\ndoors of the house in which the within-named Mrs. Bargrave lives; who\\nbelieves his kinswoman to be of so discerning a spirit, as not to be put\\nupon by any fallacy; and who positively assured him that the whole\\nmatter, as it is related and laid down, is really true; and what she\\nherself had in the same words, as near as may be, from Mrs. Bargrave's\\nown mouth, who, she knows, had no reason to invent and publish such a\\nstory, or any design to forge and tell a lie, being a woman of much\\nhonesty and virtue, and her whole life a course, as it were, of piety.\\nThe use which we ought to make of it, is to consider, that there is a\\nlife to come after this, and a just God, who will retribute to every one\\naccording to the deeds done in the body; and therefore to reflect upon\\nour past course of life we have led in the world; that our time is short\\nand uncertain; and that if we would escape the punishment of the\\nungodly, and receive the reward of the righteous, which is the laying\\nhold of eternal life, we ought, for the time to come, to return to God\\nby a speedy repentance, ceasing to do evil, and learning to do well: to\\nseek after God early, if happily He may be found of us, and lead such\\nlives for the future, as may be well pleasing in His sight.\\n\\n\\nA RELATION OF THE APPARITION OF MRS. VEAL\\n\\nThis thing is so rare in all its circumstances, and on so good\\nauthority, that my reading and conversation has not given me anything\\nlike it: it is fit to gratify the most ingenious and serious inquirer.\\nMrs. Bargrave is the person to whom Mrs. Veal appeared after her death;\\nshe is my intimate friend, and I can avouch for her reputation, for\\nthese last fifteen or sixteen years, on my own knowledge; and I can\\nconfirm the good character she had from her youth, to the time of my\\nacquaintance. Though, since this relation, she is calumniated by some\\npeople, that are friends to the brother of this Mrs. Veal, who appeared;\\nwho think the relation of this appearance to be a reflection, and\\nendeavor what they can to blast Mrs. Bargrave's reputation, and to laugh\\nthe story out of countenance. But by the circumstances thereof, and the\\ncheerful disposition of Mrs. Bargrave, notwithstanding the ill-usage of\\na very wicked husband, there is not yet the least sign of dejection in\\nher face; nor did I ever hear her let fall a desponding or murmuring\\nexpression; nay, not when actually under her husband's barbarity; which\\nI have been witness to, and several other persons of undoubted\\nreputation.\\n\\nNow you must know, Mrs. Veal was a maiden gentlewoman of about thirty\\nyears of age, and for some years last past had been troubled with fits;\\nwhich were perceived coming on her, by her going off from her discourse\\nvery abruptly to some impertinence. She was maintained by an only\\nbrother, and kept his house in Dover. She was a very pious woman, and\\nher brother a very sober man to all appearance; but now he does all he\\ncan to null or quash the story. Mrs. Veal was intimately acquainted with\\nMrs. Bargrave from her childhood. Mrs. Veal's circumstances were then\\nmean; her father did not take care of his children as he ought, so that\\nthey were exposed to hardships; and Mrs. Bargrave, in those days, had as\\nunkind a father, though she wanted neither for food nor clothing, whilst\\nMrs. Veal wanted for both; insomuch that she would often say, Mrs.\\nBargrave, you are not only the best, but the only friend I have in the\\nworld, and no circumstances of life shall ever dissolve my friendship.\\nThey would often condole each other's adverse fortunes, and read\\ntogether Drelincourt upon Death, and other good books; and so, like two\\nChristian friends, they comforted each other under their sorrow.\\n\\nSome time after, Mr. Veal's friends got him a place in the custom-house\\nat Dover, which occasioned Mrs. Veal, by little and little, to fall off\\nfrom her intimacy with Mrs. Bargrave, though there was never any such\\nthing as a quarrel; but an indifferency came on by degrees, till at last\\nMrs. Bargrave had not seen her in two years and a half; though above a\\ntwelvemonth of the time Mrs. Bargrave hath been absent from Dover, and\\nthis last half year has been in Canterbury about two months of the time,\\ndwelling in a house of her own.\\n\\nIn this house, on the 8th of September, 1705, she was sitting alone in\\nthe forenoon, thinking over her unfortunate life, and arguing herself\\ninto a due resignation to providence, though her condition seemed hard.\\nAnd, said she, I have been provided for hitherto, and doubt not but I\\nshall be still; and am well satisfied that my afflictions shall end when\\nit is most fit for me: and then took up her sewing-work, which she had\\nno sooner done, but she hears a knocking at the door. She went to see\\nwho was there, and this proved to be Mrs. Veal, her old friend, who was\\nin a riding-habit. At that moment of time the clock struck twelve at\\nnoon.\\n\\nMadam, says Mrs. Bargrave, I am surprised to see you, you have been so\\nlong a stranger; but told her, she was glad to see her, and offered to\\nsalute her; which Mrs. Veal complied with, till their lips almost\\ntouched; and then Mrs. Veal drew her hand across her own eyes, and said,\\nI am not very well; and so waived it. She told Mrs. Bargrave, she was\\ngoing a journey, and had a great mind to see her first. But, says Mrs.\\nBargrave, how came you to take a journey alone? I am amazed at it,\\nbecause I know you have a fond brother. Oh! says Mrs. Veal, I gave my\\nbrother the slip, and came away because I had so great a desire to see\\nyou before I took my journey. So Mrs. Bargrave went in with her, into\\nanother room within the first, and Mrs. Veal sat her down in an\\nelbow-chair, in which Mrs. Bargrave was sitting when she heard Mrs. Veal\\nknock. Then says Mrs. Veal, My dear friend, I am come to renew our old\\nfriendship again, and beg your pardon for my breach of it; and if you\\ncan forgive me, you are the best of women. O, says Mrs. Bargrave, do not\\nmention such a thing; I have not had an uneasy thought about it; I can\\neasily forgive it. What did you think of me? said Mrs. Veal. Says Mrs.\\nBargrave, I thought you were like the rest of the world, and that\\nprosperity had made you forget yourself and me. Then Mrs. Veal reminded\\nMrs. Bargrave of the many friendly offices she did her in former days,\\nand much of the conversation they had with each other in the times of\\ntheir adversity; what books they read, and what comfort, in particular,\\nthey received from Drelincourt's Book of Death, which was the best, she\\nsaid, on that subject ever written. She also mentioned Dr. Sherlock, the\\ntwo Dutch books which were translated, written upon death, and several\\nothers. But Drelincourt, she said, had the clearest notions of death,\\nand of the future state, of any who had handled that subject. Then she\\nasked Mrs. Bargrave, whether she had Drelincourt. She said, Yes. Says\\nMrs. Veal, Fetch it. And so Mrs. Bargrave goes up stairs and brings it\\ndown. Says Mrs. Veal, Dear Mrs. Bargrave, if the eyes of our faith were\\nas open as the eyes of our body, we should see numbers of angels about\\nus for our guard. The notions we have of heaven now, are nothing like\\nwhat it is, as Drelincourt says; therefore be comforted under your\\nafflictions, and believe that the Almighty has a particular regard to\\nyou; and that your afflictions are marks of God's favor; and when they\\nhave done the business they are sent for, they shall be removed from\\nyou. And believe me, my dear friend, believe what I say to you, one\\nminute of future happiness will infinitely reward you for all your\\nsufferings. For, I can never believe (and claps her hand upon her knee\\nwith great earnestness, which indeed ran through most of her discourse),\\nthat ever God will suffer you to spend all your days in this afflicted\\nstate; but be assured, that your afflictions shall leave you, or you\\nthem, in a short time. She spake in that pathetical and heavenly\\nmanner, that Mrs. Bargrave wept several times, she was so deeply\\naffected with it.\\n\\nThen Mrs. Veal mentioned Dr. Kenrick's Ascetick, at the end of which he\\ngives an account of the lives of the primitive Christians. Their pattern\\nshe recommended to our imitation, and said, their conversation was not\\nlike this of our age: For now, says she, there is nothing but frothy,\\nvain discourse, which is far different from theirs. Theirs was to\\nedification, and to build one another up in faith; so that they were not\\nas we are, nor are we as they were: but, says she, we ought to do as\\nthey did. There was an hearty friendship among them; but where is it now\\nto be found? Says Mrs. Bargrave, It is hard indeed to find a true friend\\nin these days. Says Mrs. Veal, Mr. Norris has a fine copy of verses,\\ncalled Friendship in Perfection, which I wonderfully admire. Have you\\nseen the book? says Mrs. Veal. No, says Mrs. Bargrave, but I have the\\nverses of my own writing out. Have you? says Mrs. Veal, then fetch them.\\nWhich she did from above stairs, and offered them to Mrs. Veal to read,\\nwho refused, and waived the thing, saying, holding down her head would\\nmake it ache; and then desired Mrs. Bargrave to read them to her, which\\nshe did. As they were admiring friendship, Mrs. Veal said, Dear Mrs.\\nBargrave, I shall love you for ever. In these verses there is twice used\\nthe word Elysian. Ah! says Mrs. Veal, these poets have such names for\\nheaven. She would often draw her hands across her own eyes, and say,\\nMrs. Bargrave, do not you think I am mightily impaired by my fits? No,\\nsays Mrs. Bargrave, I think you look as well as ever I knew you. After\\nall this discourse, which the apparition put in much finer words than\\nMrs. Bargrave said she could pretend to, and as much more than she can\\nremember, (for it cannot be thought, that an hour and three quarters'\\nconversation could all be retained, though the main of it she thinks she\\ndoes,) she said to Mrs. Bargrave, she would have her write a letter to\\nher brother, and tell him, she would have him give rings to such and\\nsuch; and that there was a purse of gold in her cabinet, and that she\\nwould have two broad pieces given to her cousin Watson.\\n\\nTalking at this rate, Mrs. Bargrave thought that a fit was coming upon\\nher, and so placed herself in a chair just before her knees, to keep her\\nfrom falling to the ground, if her fits should occasion it: for the\\nelbow-chair, she thought, would keep her from falling on either side.\\nAnd to divert Mrs. Veal, as she thought, took hold of her gown-sleeve\\nseveral times, and commended it. Mrs. Veal told her, it was a scowered\\nsilk, and newly made up. But for all this, Mrs. Veal persisted in her\\nrequest, and told Mrs. Bargrave, she must not deny her: and she would\\nhave her tell her brother all their conversation, when she had\\nopportunity. Dear Mrs. Veal, says Mrs. Bargrave, this seems so\\nimpertinent, that I cannot tell how to comply with it; and what a\\nmortifying story will our conversation be to a young gentleman? Why,\\nsays Mrs. Bargrave, it is much better, methinks, to do it yourself. No,\\nsays Mrs. Veal, though it seems impertinent to you now, you will see\\nmore reason for it hereafter. Mrs. Bargrave then, to satisfy her\\nimportunity, was going to fetch a pen and ink; but Mrs. Veal said, Let\\nit alone now, but do it when I am gone; but you must be sure to do it:\\nwhich was one of the last things she enjoined her at parting; and so she\\npromised her.\\n\\nThen Mrs. Veal asked for Mrs. Bargrave's daughter; she said, she was not\\nat home: But if you have a mind to see her, says Mrs. Bargrave, I'll\\nsend for her. Do, says Mrs. Veal. On which she left her, and went to a\\nneighbor's to seek for her; and by the time Mrs. Bargrave was returning,\\nMrs. Veal was got without the door in the street, in the face of the\\nbeast-market, on a Saturday, which is market-day, and stood ready to\\npart, as soon as Mrs. Bargrave came to her. She asked her, why she was\\nin such haste. She said she must be going, though perhaps she might not\\ngo her journey till Monday; and told Mrs. Bargrave, she hoped she should\\nsee her again at her cousin Watson's, before she went whither she was\\ngoing. Then she said, she would take her leave of her, and walked from\\nMrs. Bargrave in her view, till a turning interrupted the sight of her,\\nwhich was three quarters after one in the afternoon.\\n\\nMrs. Veal died the 7th of September, at twelve o'clock at noon of her\\nfits, and had not above four hours' senses before her death, in which\\ntime she received the sacrament. The next day after Mrs. Veal's\\nappearing, being Sunday, Mrs. Bargrave was mightily indisposed with a\\ncold, and a sore throat, that she could not go out that day; but on\\nMonday morning she sent a person to Captain Watson's, to know if Mrs.\\nVeal was there. They wondered at Mrs. Bargrave's inquiry; and sent her\\nword, that she was not there, nor was expected. At this answer Mrs.\\nBargrave told the maid she had certainly mistook the name, or made some\\nblunder. And though she was ill, she put on her hood, and went herself\\nto Captain Watson's though she knew none of the family, to see if Mrs.\\nVeal was there or not. They said, they wondered at her asking, for that\\nshe had not been in town; they were sure, if she had, she would have\\nbeen there. Says Mrs. Bargrave, I am sure she was with me on Saturday\\nalmost two hours. They said, it was impossible; for they must have seen\\nher if she had. In comes Captain Watson, while they were in dispute, and\\nsaid, that Mrs. Veal was certainly dead, and her escutcheons were\\nmaking. This strangely surprised Mrs. Bargrave, when she sent to the\\nperson immediately who had the care of them, and found it true. Then she\\nrelated the whole story to Captain Watson's family, and what gown she\\nhad on, and how striped; and that Mrs. Veal told her, it was scowered.\\nThen Mrs. Watson cried out, You have seen her indeed, for none knew, but\\nMrs. Veal and myself, that the gown was scowered. And Mrs. Watson owned,\\nthat she described the gown exactly: For, said she, I helped her to make\\nit up. This Mrs. Watson blazed all about the town, and avouched the\\ndemonstration of the truth of Mrs. Bargrave's seeing Mrs. Veal's\\napparition. And Captain Watson carried two gentlemen immediately to Mrs.\\nBargrave's house, to hear the relation of her own mouth. And when it\\nspread so fast, that gentlemen and persons of quality, the judicious and\\nskeptical part of the world, flocked in upon her, it at last became such\\na task, that she was forced to go out of the way. For they were, in\\ngeneral, extremely satisfied of the truth of the thing, and plainly saw\\nthat Mrs. Bargrave was no hypochondraic; for she always appears with\\nsuch a cheerful air, and pleasing mien, that she has gained the favor\\nand esteem of all the gentry; and it is thought a great favor, if they\\ncan but get the relation from her own mouth. I should have told you\\nbefore, that Mrs. Veal told Mrs. Bargrave, that her sister and\\nbrother-in-law were just come down from London to see her. Says Mrs.\\nBargrave, How came you to order matters so strangely? It could not be\\nhelped, says Mrs. Veal. And her brother and sister did come to see her,\\nand entered the town of Dover just as Mrs. Veal was expiring. Mrs.\\nBargrave, asked her, whether she would drink some tea. Says Mrs. Veal,\\nI do not care if I do; but I'll warrant you, this mad fellow (meaning\\nMrs. Bargrave's husband) has broke all your trinkets. But, says Mrs.\\nBargrave, I'll get something to drink in for all that; but Mrs. Veal\\nwaived it, and said, It is no matter, let it alone; and so it passed.\\n\\nAll the time I sat with Mrs. Bargrave, which was some hours, she\\nrecollected fresh sayings of Mrs. Veal. And one material thing more she\\ntold Mrs. Bargrave, that old Mr. Breton allowed Mrs. Veal ten pounds a\\nyear; which was a secret, and unknown to Mrs. Bargrave, till Mrs. Veal\\ntold it her.\\n\\nMrs. Bargrave never varies in her story; which puzzles those who doubt\\nof the truth, or are unwilling to believe it. A servant in the\\nneighbor's yard, adjoining to Mrs. Bargrave's house, heard her talking\\nto somebody an hour of the time Mrs. Veal was with her. Mrs. Bargrave\\nwent out to her next neighbor's the very moment she parted with Mrs.\\nVeal, and told her what ravishing conversation she had with an old\\nfriend, and told the whole of it. Drelincourt's Book of Death is, since\\nthis happened, bought up strangely. And it is to be observed, that\\nnotwithstanding all the trouble and fatigue Mrs. Bargrave has undergone\\nupon this account, she never took the value of a farthing, nor suffered\\nher daughter to take anything of anybody, and therefore can have no\\ninterest in telling the story.\\n\\nBut Mr. Veal does what he can to stifle the matter, and said, he would\\nsee Mrs. Bargrave; but yet it is certain matter of fact that he has been\\nat Captain Watson's since the death of his sister, and yet never went\\nnear Mrs. Bargrave; and some of his friends report her to be a liar,\\nand that she knew of Mr. Breton's ten pounds a year. But the person who\\npretends to say so, has the reputation of a notorious liar, among\\npersons whom I know to be of undoubted credit. Now Mr. Veal is more of a\\ngentleman than to say she lies; but says, a bad husband has crazed her.\\nBut she needs only present herself, and it will effectually confute that\\npretense. Mr. Veal says, he asked his sister on her death-bed, whether\\nshe had a mind to dispose of anything? And she said, No. Now, the things\\nwhich Mrs. Veal's apparition would have disposed of, were so trifling,\\nand nothing of justice aimed at in their disposal, that the design of it\\nappears to me to be only in order to make Mrs. Bargrave so to\\ndemonstrate the truth of her appearance, as to satisfy the world of the\\nreality thereof, as to what she had seen and heard; and to secure her\\nreputation among the reasonable and understanding part of mankind. And\\nthen again, Mr. Veal owns, that there was a purse of gold; but it was\\nnot found in her cabinet, but in a comb-box. This looks improbable; for\\nthat Mrs. Watson owned, that Mrs. Veal was so very careful of the key of\\nthe cabinet, that she would trust nobody with it. And if so, no doubt\\nshe would not trust her gold out of it. And Mrs. Veal's often drawing\\nher hand over her eyes, and asking Mrs. Bargrave whether her fits had\\nnot impaired her, looks to me as if she did it on purpose to remind Mrs.\\nBargrave of her fits, to prepare her not to think it strange that she\\nshould put her upon writing to her brother to dispose of rings and gold,\\nwhich looked so much like a dying person's request; and it took\\naccordingly with Mrs. Bargrave, as the effects of her fits coming upon\\nher; and was one of the many instances of her wonderful love to her, and\\ncare of her, that she should not be affrighted; which indeed appears in\\nher whole management, particularly in her coming to her in the day-time,\\nwaiving the salutation, and when she was alone; and then the manner of\\nher parting, to prevent a second attempt to salute her.\\n\\nNow, why Mr. Veal should think this relation a reflection, as it is\\nplain he does, by his endeavoring to stifle it, I cannot imagine;\\nbecause the generality believe her to be a good spirit, her discourse\\nwas so heavenly. Her two great errands were to comfort Mrs. Bargrave in\\nher affliction, and to ask her forgiveness for the breach of friendship,\\nand with a pious discourse to encourage her. So that, after all, to\\nsuppose that Mrs. Bargrave could hatch such an invention as this from\\nFriday noon till Saturday noon, supposing that she knew of Mrs. Veal's\\ndeath the very first moment, without jumbling circumstances, and without\\nany interest too; she must be more witty, fortunate, and wicked too,\\nthan any indifferent person, I dare say, will allow. I asked Mrs.\\nBargrave several times, if she was sure she felt the gown? She answered\\nmodestly, If my senses be to be relied on, I am sure of it. I asked her,\\nif she heard a sound when she clapped her hand upon her knee? She said,\\nshe did not remember she did; but said she appeared to be as much a\\nsubstance as I did, who talked with her. And I may, said she, be as soon\\npersuaded, that your apparition is talking to me now, as that I did not\\nreally see her: for I was under no manner of fear, and received her as a\\nfriend, and parted with her as such. I would not, says she, give one\\nfarthing to make any one believe it: I have no interest in it; nothing\\nbut trouble is entailed upon me for a long time, for aught I know; and\\nhad it not come to light by accident, it would never have been made\\npublic. But now, she says, she will make her own private use of it, and\\nkeep herself out of the way as much as she can; and so she has done\\nsince. She says, She had a gentleman who came thirty miles to her to\\nhear the relation; and that she had told it to a room full of people at\\na time. Several particular gentlemen have had the story from Mrs.\\nBargrave's own mouth.\\n\\nThis thing has very much affected me, and I am as well satisfied, as I\\nam of the best-grounded matter of fact. And why we should dispute matter\\nof fact, because we cannot solve things of which we can have no certain\\nor demonstrative notions, seems strange to me. Mrs. Bargrave's authority\\nand sincerity alone, would have been undoubted in any other case.\""

       "\"This relation is matter of fact, and attended with such circumstances, as may induce any reasonable man to believe it. It was sent by a gentleman, a justice of peace, at Maidstone, in Kent, and a very intelligent person, to his friend in London, as it is here worded; which discourse is attested by a very sober and understanding gentlewoman, a kinswoman of the said gentleman's, who lives in Canterbury, within a few doors of the house in which the within-named Mrs. Bargrave lives; who believes his kinswoman to be of so discerning a spirit, as not to be put upon by any fallacy; and who positively assured him that the whole matter, as it is related and laid down, is really true; and what she herself had in the same words, as near as may be, from Mrs. Bargrave's own mouth, who, she knows, had no reason to invent and publish such a story, or any design to forge and tell a lie, being a woman of much honesty and virtue, and her whole life a course, as it were, of piety. The use which we ought to make of it, is to consider, that there is a life to come after this, and a just God, who will retribute to every one according to the deeds done in the body; and therefore to reflect upon our past course of life we have led in the world; that our time is short and uncertain; and that if we would escape the punishment of the ungodly, and receive the reward of the righteous, which is the laying hold of eternal life, we ought, for the time to come, to return to God by a speedy repentance, ceasing to do evil, and learning to do well: to seek after God early, if happily He may be found of us, and lead such lives for the future, as may be well pleasing in His sight.   A RELATION OF THE APPARITION OF MRS. VEAL  This thing is so rare in all its circumstances, and on so good authority, that my reading and conversation has not given me anything like it: it is fit to gratify the most ingenious and serious inquirer. Mrs. Bargrave is the person to whom Mrs. Veal appeared after her death; she is my intimate friend, and I can avouch for her reputation, for these last fifteen or sixteen years, on my own knowledge; and I can confirm the good character she had from her youth, to the time of my acquaintance. Though, since this relation, she is calumniated by some people, that are friends to the brother of this Mrs. Veal, who appeared; who think the relation of this appearance to be a reflection, and endeavor what they can to blast Mrs. Bargrave's reputation, and to laugh the story out of countenance. But by the circumstances thereof, and the cheerful disposition of Mrs. Bargrave, notwithstanding the ill-usage of a very wicked husband, there is not yet the least sign of dejection in her face; nor did I ever hear her let fall a desponding or murmuring expression; nay, not when actually under her husband's barbarity; which I have been witness to, and several other persons of undoubted reputation.  Now you must know, Mrs. Veal was a maiden gentlewoman of about thirty years of age, and for some years last past had been troubled with fits; which were perceived coming on her, by her going off from her discourse very abruptly to some impertinence. She was maintained by an only brother, and kept his house in Dover. She was a very pious woman, and her brother a very sober man to all appearance; but now he does all he can to null or quash the story. Mrs. Veal was intimately acquainted with Mrs. Bargrave from her childhood. Mrs. Veal's circumstances were then mean; her father did not take care of his children as he ought, so that they were exposed to hardships; and Mrs. Bargrave, in those days, had as unkind a father, though she wanted neither for food nor clothing, whilst Mrs. Veal wanted for both; insomuch that she would often say, Mrs. Bargrave, you are not only the best, but the only friend I have in the world, and no circumstances of life shall ever dissolve my friendship. They would often condole each other's adverse fortunes, and read together Drelincourt upon Death, and other good books; and so, like two Christian friends, they comforted each other under their sorrow.  Some time after, Mr. Veal's friends got him a place in the custom-house at Dover, which occasioned Mrs. Veal, by little and little, to fall off from her intimacy with Mrs. Bargrave, though there was never any such thing as a quarrel; but an indifferency came on by degrees, till at last Mrs. Bargrave had not seen her in two years and a half; though above a twelvemonth of the time Mrs. Bargrave hath been absent from Dover, and this last half year has been in Canterbury about two months of the time, dwelling in a house of her own.  In this house, on the 8th of September, 1705, she was sitting alone in the forenoon, thinking over her unfortunate life, and arguing herself into a due resignation to providence, though her condition seemed hard. And, said she, I have been provided for hitherto, and doubt not but I shall be still; and am well satisfied that my afflictions shall end when it is most fit for me: and then took up her sewing-work, which she had no sooner done, but she hears a knocking at the door. She went to see who was there, and this proved to be Mrs. Veal, her old friend, who was in a riding-habit. At that moment of time the clock struck twelve at noon.  Madam, says Mrs. Bargrave, I am surprised to see you, you have been so long a stranger; but told her, she was glad to see her, and offered to salute her; which Mrs. Veal complied with, till their lips almost touched; and then Mrs. Veal drew her hand across her own eyes, and said, I am not very well; and so waived it. She told Mrs. Bargrave, she was going a journey, and had a great mind to see her first. But, says Mrs. Bargrave, how came you to take a journey alone? I am amazed at it, because I know you have a fond brother. Oh! says Mrs. Veal, I gave my brother the slip, and came away because I had so great a desire to see you before I took my journey. So Mrs. Bargrave went in with her, into another room within the first, and Mrs. Veal sat her down in an elbow-chair, in which Mrs. Bargrave was sitting when she heard Mrs. Veal knock. Then says Mrs. Veal, My dear friend, I am come to renew our old friendship again, and beg your pardon for my breach of it; and if you can forgive me, you are the best of women. O, says Mrs. Bargrave, do not mention such a thing; I have not had an uneasy thought about it; I can easily forgive it. What did you think of me? said Mrs. Veal. Says Mrs. Bargrave, I thought you were like the rest of the world, and that prosperity had made you forget yourself and me. Then Mrs. Veal reminded Mrs. Bargrave of the many friendly offices she did her in former days, and much of the conversation they had with each other in the times of their adversity; what books they read, and what comfort, in particular, they received from Drelincourt's Book of Death, which was the best, she said, on that subject ever written. She also mentioned Dr. Sherlock, the two Dutch books which were translated, written upon death, and several others. But Drelincourt, she said, had the clearest notions of death, and of the future state, of any who had handled that subject. Then she asked Mrs. Bargrave, whether she had Drelincourt. She said, Yes. Says Mrs. Veal, Fetch it. And so Mrs. Bargrave goes up stairs and brings it down. Says Mrs. Veal, Dear Mrs. Bargrave, if the eyes of our faith were as open as the eyes of our body, we should see numbers of angels about us for our guard. The notions we have of heaven now, are nothing like what it is, as Drelincourt says; therefore be comforted under your afflictions, and believe that the Almighty has a particular regard to you; and that your afflictions are marks of God's favor; and when they have done the business they are sent for, they shall be removed from you. And believe me, my dear friend, believe what I say to you, one minute of future happiness will infinitely reward you for all your sufferings. For, I can never believe (and claps her hand upon her knee with great earnestness, which indeed ran through most of her discourse), that ever God will suffer you to spend all your days in this afflicted state; but be assured, that your afflictions shall leave you, or you them, in a short time. She spake in that pathetical and heavenly manner, that Mrs. Bargrave wept several times, she was so deeply affected with it.  Then Mrs. Veal mentioned Dr. Kenrick's Ascetick, at the end of which he gives an account of the lives of the primitive Christians. Their pattern she recommended to our imitation, and said, their conversation was not like this of our age: For now, says she, there is nothing but frothy, vain discourse, which is far different from theirs. Theirs was to edification, and to build one another up in faith; so that they were not as we are, nor are we as they were: but, says she, we ought to do as they did. There was an hearty friendship among them; but where is it now to be found? Says Mrs. Bargrave, It is hard indeed to find a true friend in these days. Says Mrs. Veal, Mr. Norris has a fine copy of verses, called Friendship in Perfection, which I wonderfully admire. Have you seen the book? says Mrs. Veal. No, says Mrs. Bargrave, but I have the verses of my own writing out. Have you? says Mrs. Veal, then fetch them. Which she did from above stairs, and offered them to Mrs. Veal to read, who refused, and waived the thing, saying, holding down her head would make it ache; and then desired Mrs. Bargrave to read them to her, which she did. As they were admiring friendship, Mrs. Veal said, Dear Mrs. Bargrave, I shall love you for ever. In these verses there is twice used the word Elysian. Ah! says Mrs. Veal, these poets have such names for heaven. She would often draw her hands across her own eyes, and say, Mrs. Bargrave, do not you think I am mightily impaired by my fits? No, says Mrs. Bargrave, I think you look as well as ever I knew you. After all this discourse, which the apparition put in much finer words than Mrs. Bargrave said she could pretend to, and as much more than she can remember, (for it cannot be thought, that an hour and three quarters' conversation could all be retained, though the main of it she thinks she does,) she said to Mrs. Bargrave, she would have her write a letter to her brother, and tell him, she would have him give rings to such and such; and that there was a purse of gold in her cabinet, and that she would have two broad pieces given to her cousin Watson.  Talking at this rate, Mrs. Bargrave thought that a fit was coming upon her, and so placed herself in a chair just before her knees, to keep her from falling to the ground, if her fits should occasion it: for the elbow-chair, she thought, would keep her from falling on either side. And to divert Mrs. Veal, as she thought, took hold of her gown-sleeve several times, and commended it. Mrs. Veal told her, it was a scowered silk, and newly made up. But for all this, Mrs. Veal persisted in her request, and told Mrs. Bargrave, she must not deny her: and she would have her tell her brother all their conversation, when she had opportunity. Dear Mrs. Veal, says Mrs. Bargrave, this seems so impertinent, that I cannot tell how to comply with it; and what a mortifying story will our conversation be to a young gentleman? Why, says Mrs. Bargrave, it is much better, methinks, to do it yourself. No, says Mrs. Veal, though it seems impertinent to you now, you will see more reason for it hereafter. Mrs. Bargrave then, to satisfy her importunity, was going to fetch a pen and ink; but Mrs. Veal said, Let it alone now, but do it when I am gone; but you must be sure to do it: which was one of the last things she enjoined her at parting; and so she promised her.  Then Mrs. Veal asked for Mrs. Bargrave's daughter; she said, she was not at home: But if you have a mind to see her, says Mrs. Bargrave, I'll send for her. Do, says Mrs. Veal. On which she left her, and went to a neighbor's to seek for her; and by the time Mrs. Bargrave was returning, Mrs. Veal was got without the door in the street, in the face of the beast-market, on a Saturday, which is market-day, and stood ready to part, as soon as Mrs. Bargrave came to her. She asked her, why she was in such haste. She said she must be going, though perhaps she might not go her journey till Monday; and told Mrs. Bargrave, she hoped she should see her again at her cousin Watson's, before she went whither she was going. Then she said, she would take her leave of her, and walked from Mrs. Bargrave in her view, till a turning interrupted the sight of her, which was three quarters after one in the afternoon.  Mrs. Veal died the 7th of September, at twelve o'clock at noon of her fits, and had not above four hours' senses before her death, in which time she received the sacrament. The next day after Mrs. Veal's appearing, being Sunday, Mrs. Bargrave was mightily indisposed with a cold, and a sore throat, that she could not go out that day; but on Monday morning she sent a person to Captain Watson's, to know if Mrs. Veal was there. They wondered at Mrs. Bargrave's inquiry; and sent her word, that she was not there, nor was expected. At this answer Mrs. Bargrave told the maid she had certainly mistook the name, or made some blunder. And though she was ill, she put on her hood, and went herself to Captain Watson's though she knew none of the family, to see if Mrs. Veal was there or not. They said, they wondered at her asking, for that she had not been in town; they were sure, if she had, she would have been there. Says Mrs. Bargrave, I am sure she was with me on Saturday almost two hours. They said, it was impossible; for they must have seen her if she had. In comes Captain Watson, while they were in dispute, and said, that Mrs. Veal was certainly dead, and her escutcheons were making. This strangely surprised Mrs. Bargrave, when she sent to the person immediately who had the care of them, and found it true. Then she related the whole story to Captain Watson's family, and what gown she had on, and how striped; and that Mrs. Veal told her, it was scowered. Then Mrs. Watson cried out, You have seen her indeed, for none knew, but Mrs. Veal and myself, that the gown was scowered. And Mrs. Watson owned, that she described the gown exactly: For, said she, I helped her to make it up. This Mrs. Watson blazed all about the town, and avouched the demonstration of the truth of Mrs. Bargrave's seeing Mrs. Veal's apparition. And Captain Watson carried two gentlemen immediately to Mrs. Bargrave's house, to hear the relation of her own mouth. And when it spread so fast, that gentlemen and persons of quality, the judicious and skeptical part of the world, flocked in upon her, it at last became such a task, that she was forced to go out of the way. For they were, in general, extremely satisfied of the truth of the thing, and plainly saw that Mrs. Bargrave was no hypochondraic; for she always appears with such a cheerful air, and pleasing mien, that she has gained the favor and esteem of all the gentry; and it is thought a great favor, if they can but get the relation from her own mouth. I should have told you before, that Mrs. Veal told Mrs. Bargrave, that her sister and brother-in-law were just come down from London to see her. Says Mrs. Bargrave, How came you to order matters so strangely? It could not be helped, says Mrs. Veal. And her brother and sister did come to see her, and entered the town of Dover just as Mrs. Veal was expiring. Mrs. Bargrave, asked her, whether she would drink some tea. Says Mrs. Veal, I do not care if I do; but I'll warrant you, this mad fellow (meaning Mrs. Bargrave's husband) has broke all your trinkets. But, says Mrs. Bargrave, I'll get something to drink in for all that; but Mrs. Veal waived it, and said, It is no matter, let it alone; and so it passed.  All the time I sat with Mrs. Bargrave, which was some hours, she recollected fresh sayings of Mrs. Veal. And one material thing more she told Mrs. Bargrave, that old Mr. Breton allowed Mrs. Veal ten pounds a year; which was a secret, and unknown to Mrs. Bargrave, till Mrs. Veal told it her.  Mrs. Bargrave never varies in her story; which puzzles those who doubt of the truth, or are unwilling to believe it. A servant in the neighbor's yard, adjoining to Mrs. Bargrave's house, heard her talking to somebody an hour of the time Mrs. Veal was with her. Mrs. Bargrave went out to her next neighbor's the very moment she parted with Mrs. Veal, and told her what ravishing conversation she had with an old friend, and told the whole of it. Drelincourt's Book of Death is, since this happened, bought up strangely. And it is to be observed, that notwithstanding all the trouble and fatigue Mrs. Bargrave has undergone upon this account, she never took the value of a farthing, nor suffered her daughter to take anything of anybody, and therefore can have no interest in telling the story.  But Mr. Veal does what he can to stifle the matter, and said, he would see Mrs. Bargrave; but yet it is certain matter of fact that he has been at Captain Watson's since the death of his sister, and yet never went near Mrs. Bargrave; and some of his friends report her to be a liar, and that she knew of Mr. Breton's ten pounds a year. But the person who pretends to say so, has the reputation of a notorious liar, among persons whom I know to be of undoubted credit. Now Mr. Veal is more of a gentleman than to say she lies; but says, a bad husband has crazed her. But she needs only present herself, and it will effectually confute that pretense. Mr. Veal says, he asked his sister on her death-bed, whether she had a mind to dispose of anything? And she said, No. Now, the things which Mrs. Veal's apparition would have disposed of, were so trifling, and nothing of justice aimed at in their disposal, that the design of it appears to me to be only in order to make Mrs. Bargrave so to demonstrate the truth of her appearance, as to satisfy the world of the reality thereof, as to what she had seen and heard; and to secure her reputation among the reasonable and understanding part of mankind. And then again, Mr. Veal owns, that there was a purse of gold; but it was not found in her cabinet, but in a comb-box. This looks improbable; for that Mrs. Watson owned, that Mrs. Veal was so very careful of the key of the cabinet, that she would trust nobody with it. And if so, no doubt she would not trust her gold out of it. And Mrs. Veal's often drawing her hand over her eyes, and asking Mrs. Bargrave whether her fits had not impaired her, looks to me as if she did it on purpose to remind Mrs. Bargrave of her fits, to prepare her not to think it strange that she should put her upon writing to her brother to dispose of rings and gold, which looked so much like a dying person's request; and it took accordingly with Mrs. Bargrave, as the effects of her fits coming upon her; and was one of the many instances of her wonderful love to her, and care of her, that she should not be affrighted; which indeed appears in her whole management, particularly in her coming to her in the day-time, waiving the salutation, and when she was alone; and then the manner of her parting, to prevent a second attempt to salute her.  Now, why Mr. Veal should think this relation a reflection, as it is plain he does, by his endeavoring to stifle it, I cannot imagine; because the generality believe her to be a good spirit, her discourse was so heavenly. Her two great errands were to comfort Mrs. Bargrave in her affliction, and to ask her forgiveness for the breach of friendship, and with a pious discourse to encourage her. So that, after all, to suppose that Mrs. Bargrave could hatch such an invention as this from Friday noon till Saturday noon, supposing that she knew of Mrs. Veal's death the very first moment, without jumbling circumstances, and without any interest too; she must be more witty, fortunate, and wicked too, than any indifferent person, I dare say, will allow. I asked Mrs. Bargrave several times, if she was sure she felt the gown? She answered modestly, If my senses be to be relied on, I am sure of it. I asked her, if she heard a sound when she clapped her hand upon her knee? She said, she did not remember she did; but said she appeared to be as much a substance as I did, who talked with her. And I may, said she, be as soon persuaded, that your apparition is talking to me now, as that I did not really see her: for I was under no manner of fear, and received her as a friend, and parted with her as such. I would not, says she, give one farthing to make any one believe it: I have no interest in it; nothing but trouble is entailed upon me for a long time, for aught I know; and had it not come to light by accident, it would never have been made public. But now, she says, she will make her own private use of it, and keep herself out of the way as much as she can; and so she has done since. She says, She had a gentleman who came thirty miles to her to hear the relation; and that she had told it to a room full of people at a time. Several particular gentlemen have had the story from Mrs. Bargrave's own mouth.  This thing has very much affected me, and I am as well satisfied, as I am of the best-grounded matter of fact. And why we should dispute matter of fact, because we cannot solve things of which we can have no certain or demonstrative notions, seems strange to me. Mrs. Bargrave's authority and sincerity alone, would have been undoubted in any other case.\""
